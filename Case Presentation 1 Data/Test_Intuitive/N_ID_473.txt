CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm ,
without murmur , rubs or gallops. ABDOMEN: Benign. EXTREMITIES:
Mild valgus deformity of the right knee with 2+ crepitus , medial
and lateral joint line tenderness.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the
Orthopedic Service and underwent right
total knee replacement with Kinemax system. She was transferred
to the floor in stable condition. Postoperatively she had a drop
in blood pressure to a systolic of 70 with the epidural in place.
With fluid bolus , her pressure then stabilized.
On the first postoperative night the patient spiked to 103.9 with
a temperature of 99 the following morning. The epidural was
discontinued and a urine culture was sent. The urine revealed 1+
bacteria with 2+ squamous cells and 10 to 15 white blood cells.
Therefore , the Foley was discontinued and the patient given one
dose of gentamicin. A repeat white count revealed white blood
cell count of 12.9. Blood cultures , urine and epidural cultures
remained negative. She was started on CPM and this was continued
psotoperatively with the physical therapist.
On postoperative day three she again spiked to 102.4 and was
complaining of frequent urination and incontinence. Therefore ,
she was started on an empiric course of Bactrim times 48 hours.
Again , blood cultures were performed and these remained negative
at the time of discharge. The patient continued to do fairly
well with physical therapy though her progress was slow. On
postoperative day five her temperature had remained less than
100 degrees for 24 hours and her cultures remained negative. Her
wound remained clean and nonerythematous without discharge. She
had no complaints of shortness of breath or sputum production.
She remained hemodynamically stable.
It was therefore felt she was stable for discharge to the Rehab

to increase her range of motion and her ambulation.

Same as admission with Percocet one to two p.o.q. 4 to 6 hours
