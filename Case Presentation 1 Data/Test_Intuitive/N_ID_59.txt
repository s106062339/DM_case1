****HOSPITAL COURSE****
Patient was admitted for difficulty for ambulation and work up of her
leg pains. She had two pain syndromes ( 1 ) focal area of induration 2cm
above right medial malleolus with slight warmth but not true redness
or swelling. Likely chronic venous stasis vs. superficial
thrombophlebitis. DDimer was <500 and negative. This improved with
tylenol and though cellulitis was considered she was afebrile , nl WBC
count , and it did not have the clinical signs consistent with
cellulitis. Regardless it should be followed for progression. Also
considered atypical gout and this should be considered in the future if
it persists.
( 2 ) Pt complained of right sided aching lower extremity pain that was
present with ambulation. Xrays of the right lower extremity joints
including hip , knee , ankle , and LE bones showed no abnormality. She
was evaluated by physical therapy which recommended use of her cane
and that she did not have acute PT needs. Cleared to go home. Her pains
were treated with tylenol 650mg po q6hr ATC and PRN ibuprofen. The day
after admission her pain had improved and she was ambulating at baseline
with decreased discomfort. She was maintained on her outpatient
cardiovascular medications. Notably she was hypertensive but her
medications were not altered. Her BP should be followed up as an
outpatient and he BP meds titrated as needed.
She was discharged in stable condition to her son. Her NP Ezekiel Boyton
was contacted to continue follow up care. ( 479-149-2464 )
