ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: CHEST PAIN OF UNCLEAR ETIOLOGY.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Veltin is a 72 year old woman
with a past medical history
significant for coronary artery disease , diabetes , and hypertension
who presented with worsening chest pain and shortness of breath.
She had a long history of coronary artery disease with an exercise
stress test in 1997 that was positive for ischemic ST-T wave
changes. She had a catheterization at that time which revealed
diffuse three vessel disease , none of which was significant. In
1998 , she developed a left bundle branch on her EKG but it was not
clear when exactly this happened. She stated that for the past
year , she got these stabbing pains in the center of her chest that
then progressed to a squeezing pain with palpitations. Sometimes ,
there was relation to exertion but no relation to meals or position
and this chest pain had been increasing in frequency over the past
two to three weeks so now it occurred approximately two to three
times a week and was associated with shortness of breath. Two days
prior to admission , she developed constant chest pain that went to
her left arm and made four of her left fingers numb. She was quite
short of breath though she denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea ,
orthopnea , lower extremity edema , increased nocturia , and diet or
medication noncompliance.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant also for diabetes for which she
took insulin and checked her sugars at home
which ran 170 range to 200 range , hypertension , and she had
idiopathic drop attacks. She got these episodes where her legs
fell out from under her without warning but she did not lose
consciousness. She had had an MRI/MRA that showed some diffuse
small vessel disease but the MRA was normal.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 50 b.i.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 25
q.d. , Lisinopril 40 q.d. , simvastatin 10
q.d. , metformin 500 q.d. , and NPH 43 q.a.m. and 24 q.p.m.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin caused a rash and intravenous contrast dye
caused hives.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She was a retired nurses' aide who retired in
1992 , she was a widow , and she had two living
children who were grown. She lived alone and took care of her
eight year old great-grandson but had a daughter and son-in-law who
lived next door.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , significant for an elderly
obese African-American woman lying in bed in
some mild respiratory distress. Her oropharynx was moist , her
jugular venous pressure was 12 cm , her lungs had scattered crackles
at the bases , her heart was regular with an S4 , her belly was soft
and nontender , her extremities had trace edema , and her rectal
examination showed guaiac negative brown stool.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Her EKG showed a left bundle branch block
and chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary
edema and Kerley B lines. Her laboratories on admission were all
within normal limits. Her initial CK was 97 with troponin of 0.01.
ASSESSMENT: In summary , this is a 72 year old woman with multiple
cardiac risk factors who presented with chest pain of
unclear etiology. She was admitted for evaluation.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular - She was admitted for
catheterization which showed three vessel
disease , again nonsignificant and not changed from the
catheterization in 1997. She ruled out for a myocardial
infarction. She had an echo which showed some element of diastolic
dysfunction and pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 36 plus RA
but no wall motion abnormalities. It was felt that she had some
element of diastolic dysfunction that caused her to go into a bit
of pulmonary edema , maybe subendocardial ischemia. Therefore ,
while she was maintained on her aspirin and simvastatin , her blood
pressure regimen was advanced. Her heart rate was in the fifties
to sixties and Atenolol 50 b.i.d. was added. She was on a maximum
of Lisinopril at 40 milligrams so nifedipine extended release was
added and titrated up to 120 milligrams q.d. where she maintained
systolic blood pressures in the 160 range nevertheless. This could
be further titrated as an outpatient.
2. For her congestive heart failure , she diuresed approximately
four liters through admission with Lasix at 40 intravenously and
would be discharged on a seven day course of Lasix at 20 p.o. q.d.
for further diuresis.
3. Pulmonary - She did have hypoxia on admission to 85% on room
air while lying in bed. This was felt to be out of proportion to
her mild congestive heart failure and further causes were sought.
Her D-dymer was greater than 1000 and she then went for a V/Q scan
which was low probability. Her lower extremity noninvasives were
negative. She also had a chest CT which showed no interstitial
lung disease. She had pulmonary function tests which were
consistent with restrictive picture and were not much changed from
her pulmonary function tests in 1998. A pulmonary consultation was
obtained who believed that the congestive heart failure along with
obesity underlying restrictive lung disease could be the cause of
her hypoxia and , in fact , after further diuresis , her shortness of
breath much improved and she had O2 saturations that were 93% on
room air.
4. Endocrine - She was maintained on metformin during admission
and also on half of her dose of her normal dose of NPH given her
decreased p.o. intake , however , given the fact that she stated that
her sugars at home on her regimen of 43 q.a.m. and 24 q.p.m. were
170 to 200 , she was discharged on this regimen with instructions to
check her sugar and call her doctor if they were low.
DISPOSITION: She is discharged in stable condition on January ,
2000. She will follow up with Dr. Nakajima , her primary
care doctor , and in addition , with Dr. Klang , her cardiologist.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 50 b.i.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 25
q.d. , Lisinopril 40 q.d. , nifedipine
extended release 120 q.d. , metformin 500 q.d. , NPH 43 q.a.m. and 24
q.p.m. , simvastatin 10 q.d. , aspirin 325 q.d. , and Lasix 20
milligrams p.o. q.d. times seven days.
