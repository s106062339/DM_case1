Discharge Date: 9/7/2005
ATTENDING: FERRIGNO , CASEY PABLO MD
SERVICE: Cardiology Team VT
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN: Geoffrey D. Heebsh MD , PHD.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Congestive heart failure.
LIST OF PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES: Coronary artery disease , status post
myocardial infarction; diabetes mellitus; hypertension;
hypothyroidism; and anxiety.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly , this is an 82-year-old male
with a history of CHF with an EF 10% to 15% who is status post
MI , history of hypertension , diabetes mellitus , and
hypothyroidism. There is also a question of a history of atrial
fibrillation as well.
In the past 2 months , the patient had complaints of increasing
dyspnea on exertion with being unable to walk from one end of the
room to the other without becoming short of breath; a mild weight
gain of 3 pounds as well; and a stable , 2-pillow orthopnea.
On August , 2005 , the patient awakened from sleep with a sudden
onset of shortness of breath and chest pressure associated with
nausea and vomiting. The patient presented to an outside
hospital emergency department where his blood pressure was
stable , and he was saturating 94% on room air. He was treated
with IV Lopressor and nitroglycerin , sublingual and topical. He
was admitted at that hospital , and Cardiology was consulted who
diagnosed him with a mild CHF by his physical examination. A
chest x-ray was with bibasilar opacities that were more likely
atelectasis. The patient was ruled out for an MI at that
hospital and treated with Lasix at the home doses of Lasix 40 mg
p.o. b.i.d. with stable systolic blood pressures of 100s to 110s.
His course at that hospital was complicated by a nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia through which he was asymptomatic. He
was started on Lovenox b.i.d. for a low EF.
The patient was transferred to the Laismode Hospital
on May , 2005 , for elective placement of an AICD.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Atrial fibrillation , anxiety , CHF with an
EF of 10% to 15% , MI , diabetes mellitus , hypertension ,
hypothyroidism , status post cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis ,
and a history of probable prostate ??___??.
MEDICATIONS: The patient's home medications had included Lasix
40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , KCl 10 mEq q.d. , glyburide 7.5 mg q.d. ,
Levoxyl 150 mcg q.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.d. , digoxin 0.125 mg
q.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d. , atenelol 25 mg p.o. q.d. ,
trazodone 50 mg to 100 mg q.h.s. p.r.n. insomnia , and Ativan 0.5
mg p.r.n.
Transfer medications include digoxin 0.125 mg q.d. , levothyroxine
150 mcg q.d. , glyburide 7.5 mg q.d. , Lasix 40 mg b.i.d. , Zocor 20
mg p.o. q.d. , Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d. ,
atenelol 25 mg p.o. q.d. , aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , KCl 10 mEq
p.o. q.d. , trazodone 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. , and Ativan 0.5 mg p.o.
q.h.s. , and there is a question whether the patient was currently
on Lovenox 100 mg subcutaneously b.i.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is an ex-smoker and quit smoking
greater than 20 years ago. He lives with his wife.
FAMILY HSITORY: Both the parents of the patient are with a CAD
in their 70s.
PHYSICAL EXAMIANTION: The patient's vital signs upon arriving on
the floor; temperature was 94.5 , pulse was 64 , blood pressure was
120/60 , respirations were 20 , and he was saturating 98% on room
air. Examination was remarkable for JVP at his jaw and moist
mucous membranes. Heart had a regular rate and rhythm with
frequent ectopy and S1 , S2 , S3 , and S4. The lungs were with a
faint left bibasilar crackles. Abdomen was benign. The
extremities were with no pitting edema but slightly cool
bilaterally. Neurological examination is nonfocal.
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA: Remarkable for a creatinine of 0.9.
CBC was unremarkable. BNP was 2035. INR was 1.3 , and PTT was
37.4.
Of note , an echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital on
July , 2005 , showed an EF of 10% to 15% , moderate left atrial
enlargement , right atrial enlargement , mild to moderate aortic
regurgitation , mild MR and mild TR , and pulmonary artery
pressures of 45.
An ETT myoview performed at the outside hospital showed a large
fixed defect inferiorly and inferolaterally as well as a mild
ischemia in the lateral wall.
EKG at the outside hospital performed on July , 2005 , was with
sinus rhythm; right bundle-branch block with T wave inversion in
V1 through V4; Q waves in II , III , and aVF; first-degree AV
block; and a question of a left anterior fascicular block.
A chest x-ray at the outside hospital on August , 2005 , was with
bibasilar opacities with a question of atelectasis versus
pneumonia.
Admission EKG here on May , 2005 , was unchanged from the
outside hospital.
Admission chest x-ray on done on May , 2005 , showed
cardiomegaly and mild bilateral costophrenic angle blunting.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Subjectively , this is an 82-year-old male with
a history of congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction
of 10% to 15% status post myocardial infarction , hypertension ,
diabetes mellitus , and hypothyroidism who was transferred to the
Las Health Network for an elective automatic
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement.
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia. The patient had no active
ischemia. He does have a history of a myocardial infarction ,
which was inferior in area. His ETT-MIBI was with mild lateral
wall ischemia with a large fixed inferior and inferolateral
defect. The patient was continued on aspirin , ACE inhibitor , and
statin and restarted on his beta-blocker. A catheterization was
performed on May , 2005 , which demonstrated a left dominant
system and no significant left main or left anterior descending
artery lesions. A left posterior descending artery had an 80%
lesion in the mid posterior descending artery. Ejection fraction
was estimated at 15% with global hypokinesis and dilated left
atrium and dilated left ventricle. The patient had elevated
wedge pressure of 42 and 2+ mitral regurgitation.
2. Pump: The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy.
On admission , he was volume overloaded with a BNP of 2035. On
admission , the patient was treated with Lasix , Isordil , ACE
inhibitor , and digoxin. Hydralazine was added. A
catheterization on May , 2005 , demonstrated elevated left
heart-filling pressures. The patient was diuresed subsequently
with more than 4 liters and was euvolemic upon discharge. The
patient is currently euvolemic on p.o. Lasix to being slightly
dry. Given increased CO2 but a normal BUN and creatinine , we
have changed the patient's Lasix dose to 60 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 40
mg p.o. q.p.m. upon discharge. Given the systolic blood
pressures in the 90s and 100s , the patient's lisinopril was
changed to 20 mg p.o. q.d. The patient is to be followed by VNA
at home to monitor blood pressure.
3. Rhythm: The patient was followed by EP. His admission
electrocardiogram showed a right bundle-branch block with a
question of left anterior fascicular block and a first-degree
arteriovenous block. On October , 2005 , the patient became
suddenly bradycardic to the 30s and 40s with nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia x30 beats and a new second-degree
arteriovenous block type 1. The patient was asymptomatic
throughout this. Zoll pads were placed , and atropine was put at
the bedside. On August , 2005 , the patient appeared to be back in
normal sinus rhythm. On August , 2005 , a pacemaker with automatic
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was placed with cardiac
resynchronization therapy as well. This was interrogated on June , 2005 , and the ??___?? were confined. The patient will follow
up with Dr. Valko in EP on July , 2005 , at 10:20 a.m. The
patient is to avoid vigorous activity.
4. Endocrine: The patient is with diabetes mellitus and was
covered with regular insulin sliding scale here. He was advised
to restart on his home dose of glyburide 7.5 mg q.d. upon
discharge. The patients' history of hypothyroidism and thyroid
function test is consistent with sick euthyroid syndrome. He was
continued on levothyroxine at his home dose.
5. Psychiatry: The patient is given trazodone and Ativan q.h.s.
p.r.n. The patient's mental status was somewhat decreased on the
night of August , 2005 , status post automatic implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator placement. He was not oriented to
time. This later resolved by the evening of September , 2005.
6. Genitourinary: The patient was noted to have bloody urine
after receiving heparin during the catheterization thought
secondary to Foley trauma. There were no clots; however , given
significant hematuria , ??___?? Foley was placed and bladder
irrigation was started. Urinalysis was negative. Urine was pink
colored by the night of September , 2005. The Foley was discontinued
due to a leakage. This was not replaced given good urine output ,
continued pink-colored urine , and no clots. The patient's
hematocrit was stable throughout this.
7. Prophylaxis: The patient was given pneumoboots given the new
automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement and
hematuria.
8. Infectious Disease: The patient is to be on clindamycin for
7 days status post pacemaker placement.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , atenolol 12.5 mg
p.o. q.d. , clindamycin 300 mg p.o. q.i.d. through May , 2005 ,
digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 60 mg p.o. q.a.m. and Lasix 40
mg p.o. q.p.m. , hydralazine 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , levothyroxine 150
mcg p.o. q.d. , lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Ativan 0.5 mg p.o.
q.h.s. p.r.n. insomnia , trazodone 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n.
insomnia , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d. ,
glyburide 7.5 mg p.o. q.d. , magnesium oxide 800 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
and KCl slow release 20 mEq p.o. q.d.
DIET: The patient's diet on discharge; the patient should
measure weight daily; continue a low-cholesterol , low-fat , and
low-sodium diet , ADA 2100 calories per day.
ACTIVITIES: No vigorous activity of the left arm for 1 month and
no lifting of the left arm above the shoulder. The patient
should not drive until a followup appointment.
FOLLOWUP APPOINTMENTS: The patient is to see Dr. Isaias Topper
and Landon Ducayne , nurse practitioner. The clinic will call the
patient with his appointment time. The patient is to see Dr.
Marcelo Annis on July , 2005 , at 10:20 a.m. at the Hamarbo Hospital .
