Discharge Date: 1/1/2002
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: 1. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
2. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
3. URINARY TRACT INFECTION.
4. DIABETES MELLITUS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 70-year-old woman who
was followed in cardiology by
Dr. Pikula who has presumed diastolic dysfunction , who was in her
usual state of health until 1/23 , when she was admitted to the Dobubay Naicent University Of Medical Center with a flare of Crohn's ileitis.
At the time of her discharge , she was not restarted on her Lasix
and subsequently developed fluid retention with gradual worsening ,
shortness of breath and lower extremity edema. The patient noted a
20 lb weight gain during this period , as well as increasing
orthopnea and increasing dyspnea on exertion when getting dressed
or doing any different movements. She was seen in cardiology
clinic on 8/3/02 and found to be in much worse congestive heart
failure with new atrial fibrillation. She was transferred then to
the emergency department here at the Peresvillee Nawvine University Of Hospitals And Clinics .
Her most recent echocardiogram on 4/29/01 revealed mild to
moderate left ventricular hypertrophy without any regional wall
motion abnormalities. Her systolic ejection fraction was estimated
to be 60% suggesting a diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction and heart
failure. She was admitted with volume overload for diuresis.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The review of symptoms was notable for chest
tightness with occasional palpitations. She
experienced no dizziness , no syncope and no recent diarrhea , no
abdominal pain , no nausea or vomiting. She did report chronic
arthritis.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ( 1 ) Significant for congestive heart failure
due to diastolic dysfunction , ( 2 ) Crohn's
colitis diagnosed in 1963 , ( 3 ) Right breast carcinoma stage II
previously treated , not currently active , ( 4 ) Diabetes mellitus ,
( 5 ) Obstructive sleep apnea , ( 6 ) Gastroesophageal reflux disease ,
( 7 ) Hypercholesterolemia , ( 8 ) Osteoarthritis.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a prior tobacco smoker , having
smoked two packs per day for 38 years , but has
quit. She does not drink alcohol and does not use any recreational
drugs. The patient lives in Di with a friend and is a retired
x-ray technician.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
ALLERGIES: The patient's medical allergies include penicillin ,
which causes a rash , Demerol and Dilaudid causing
nausea , and Macrodantin.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Included a temperature of 97 ,
heart rate 76 , blood pressure 90/60 ,
respiratory rate 28 , and a saturation of 97% on room air. The
patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation. GENERAL: Physical
examination showed that the patient was alert and oriented x3 , in
no acute distress , having shortness of breath while sitting up in
bed. HEENT: Normocephalic , atraumatic , pupils equal , round , and
reactive , extraocular movements were intact. NECK: Showed jugular
venous distention to at least 20 cm. CHEST: Showed crackles
posteriorly approximately half of the way up. CARDIOVASCULAR:
Showed an irregular rhythm and a systolic ejection murmur
consistent with the prior diagnosis of aortic stenosis. ABDOMEN:
Showed profound obesity. EXTREMITIES: Showed significant pitting
edema bilaterally over the calves.
LABORATORY DATA: Showed a white blood cell count of 7 , hematocrit
31 , platelets of 148. Sodium was 142 , potassium
3.9 , BUN 56 , creatinine 1.3 , with a glucose of 75. Liver function
tests were normal. CK was 44 and troponin was 0.02. A chest x-ray
showed mild pulmonary vascular congestion without any evidence of
infiltrates. EKG showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 72 ,
otherwise no abnormalities beside some nonspecific ST-T wave
changes. Urinalysis showed evidence of an urinary tract infection
with 20-30 white blood cells and was leukocyte esterase positive.
Urine culture was sent at that time.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Congestive heart failure - The patient was
started on IV Lasix along with Zaroxolyn and
responded with a brisk diuresis over the course of the admission.
The patient's weight declined by approximately 5.2 kg. It was
estimated that the total volume of fluid removed was approximately
15 liters. The patient was reported great improvement in her
symptoms , was able to ambulate without requiring supplemental
oxygen. The patient was switched to oral Lasix and continued her
diuresis. The day prior to discharge , the patient was switched to
oral torsemide , and she will be discharged on that medication.
2. Atrial fibrillation - The patient was noted to have new onset
of atrial fibrillation while being seen in cardiology clinic on
8/3/02 . Since it was not known how long the atrial fibrillation
had been going on , a decision was made to anticoagulate the
patient. She was initially started on intravenous unfractionated
heparin while starting anticoagulation with Coumadin. The patient
reached a therapeutic INR of 2.5 within approximately 4-5 days and
the IV heparin was discontinued. At the time of discharge , the
patient INR was 3.2. She will have INR follow up through her
primary cardiologist , Dr. Janousek . Currently , the decision to
cardiovert the patient is left in the hands of her outpatient
cardiologist.
3. Urinary tract infection - The patient's initial urinalysis
indicated a bacterial urinary tract infection. Subsequent urine
culture grew out E. coli , which was subsequently determined to be
resistant to levofloxacin. Initially , the patient had been started
on IV levofloxacin , which was subsequently changed to p.o.
cefixime. The patient completed a five-day course of p.o. cefixime
while here in the hospital and was discharged on that medicine to
complete a 10-day course. Of note , the initial symptoms the
patient had including hematuria , resolved by the time of discharge.
4. Diabetes mellitus - The patient has a long history of diabetes
requiring insulin treatment. She is followed by endocrinologist at
the Kingnix Lowemar W.kell Medical Center .  During this hospitalization , her
blood sugars were maintained with insulin subcutaneous injections.
The patient is to continue the management of her diabetes per her
endocrinologist.
