BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
47 yo m with morbid obesity admitted for elective
pericardiocentesis and R heart cath after dx pericardial effusion
week pta. HPI:
PT had recent UMC admission for pleural effusion ( transudative , no ev
infx or malig ) , dx with PE and started on Coumadin. Then readmitted last
week with increasing sx
exertional dyspnea/lighheadedness. Found on echo to have 2-cm
pericardial effusion. Could not be tapped due to elevated INR ( on
coumadin empirically for ? PE as cause of effusion ) , so pt d/c'd and
returns today for procedure. R heart cath today shows equalization
of pressures-->tamponade physiology. However , subxyphoid
pericardiocentesis felt not safe given habitus , CT surgery consulted
re window placement , feel not safe given habitus unless drain already
in place. PMH: Morbid obesity , recent pleural effusion thought
possibly secondary to PE , rx with lasix and coumadin. Gastric bypass
sched February Diverticulitis , s/p sigmoid colectomy. L tibial ORIF.
Former smoker. ON EXAM T 98 , P 86 , BP 102/58 , RR 18 , O2 sat 94% RA.
Gen morbidly obese male. JVP , Kussmaul's difficult to assess.
Diminished breath sounds at bases. Distant HS. Abd obese , with
hernia , no tenderness. Ext 1-2+ edema , LLE>RLE ( chronic per
pt ). Hospital
Course: 1.
CV Ischemia: no
issues Pump: 8/15/05 drained 400 cc bloody fluid by
transcutaneuous approach , sent for studies , c/w hemopericardium
and exudative process ,
cytology is pending at time of discharge. Pt feeling better. ESR , CRP , RA ,
PPD negative
last admission. May have some pericardial irritation from drain , rx
with morphine , not nsaids. Cards fellow pulled drain
in PM 6/16 , repeat ECHO 1/12 showed no accum of fluid ( prelim report
says nl EF , with fat pad over anterior R ventricle ). Restarted
lasix at home dose 8/9 Atenolol had been held at time of
admission , instructed to restart at time of d/c home. Rhythm: No acute
rhythm issues at this time; monitored on tele.
2. Pulm: Pt has been diagnosed with PE ( SOB with positive D dimer ) and
started on Coumadin 5/20 , though no V/Q scan or CT scan able to
confirm since he is too big to fit in scanner. Coumadin was held for
several days prior to this admission so that pt could undergo
pericardiocentesis. Attempt made to try to confirm PE on this
admission. AS mentioned , Pt unable to do CT PE ( weight ) is
499 pounds ) or VQ scan. Tried to arrange for open MRI 1/12 to r/o
PE and malignancy given pleural and pericardial effusion. 1/12 pt went
for open MRI at J- Hospital in Fountlar Pkwy , but pt too big
to fit in the scanner , study will need to be deferred to outpt. Since
pt's pericardial effusion c/w hemopericardium , do not recommend restarting
Coumadin at this time given risk of rebleeding and cardiac tamponade.
3. FEN: Cardiac diet 4. CODE:
FULL
4. Dispo: D/C'd home 3/25/05 with VNA services. PT instructed to make
follow up appointment with PCP Dr. Stouder within 1-2 weeks of discharge.
Unfortunately , malignancy/PE workup unable to be completed due to body
habitus. Pt planning to undergo gastric bypass in near future , would
recommend reevaluation for malignancy when he has lost sufficient weight.
