BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
71yoF with h/o recurrent breast cancer s/p 2 cycles
taxol , one year of herceptin , h/o DM , HTN who p/w one month worsening
fatigue and DOE found to have new cardiomyopathy with EF 15% and LV
mural thrombus. Fatigue began around a month ago when
taxol therapy started. No CP/PND/orthopnea , no LE edema increasing
abd girth or palpitations. Pt denies URI sx , no n/v/d , no f/c. Can
walk barely one flight before DOE , no claudication sx.
Patient sleep on side with one pillow. Noted cardiomegaly and
pleural effusion on CT 8/22 ( brca staging ) , subsequent w/u included
echo at Tulok 4/25 as described above. In ED pt had a negative I
+head CT to r/o mets , guaiac negative , started heparin drip with
bolus. PMH: Brca ( originally dx 1986 , her2 positive ) , HTN ,
DM , h/o fibroids Meds at home: lantus , metformin , glyburide ,
enalapril , protonix , aranesp q2wk , zometa. PE: T96.8 , hr99 , bp102/60 ,

negative. EKG: NSR at 96bpm , nl volts , no acute STTW
changes. Head CT negative; CXR small left effusion ,
cardiomegaly.
**************hospital course******************
1 ) Heme: L ventricular mural apical thrombus , confirmed by Echo BNGH
7/20/05. Head CT on admission showed no evidence of brain mets. On
therapeutic heparin gtt , goal PTT 60-80 sec , bridging to Coumadin
starting at 5 mg PO QD , following INR for goal 2-3. INR curr 1.4 ,
bridging with Lovenox until therapeutic; will set up f/u with
Coumadin Clinic.
2 ) Pump: New dilated cardiomyopathy , EF 15% , BNP 230. CMP likely
due to Herceptin; however , actively ruling out other possible causes ,
esp ischemic. Adenosine-MIBI 6/8/05 converted to planar imaging
due to patient claustrophobia/movement , decreased sens/spec c/w MIBI
but no obvious concerning perfusion defects on wet read; however ,
official read was 'non-diagnostic.' Consider Cath or PET
as an outpatient. ACE , SPEP/UPEP pending. Fe studies show iron
deficiency , which rules out hemochromatosis. TSH decreased at 0.333 ,
?hyperthyroidism; T4 wnl , THBR slightly elev. Slightly volume
overloaded , on Lasix 80 mg PO QD , checking daily I/O's , goal is neg
0.5-1 L daily TBB. On Enalapril , low-dose Lopressor ,
Digoxin 3 ) ID: WBC 1.9 on admission , polys 16% ` ANC
~400. Neutropenic on admission , still on precautions , WBC
increasing steadily and ANC improving. CIS T>100.5. 4 ) Ischemia:
Appreciate Cardiology consult Dr. Cornelius Hemby ( JMC ).
Enfield Hospital ( avoiding cath given neutropenia ) on Tuesday 6/8/05
to assess for CAD was non-diagnostic. Lopressor ,

protection
7 ) Onc: Per Oncology recommendations , continue to
hold Herceptin given current EF 15%.
