SERVICE: MEDICINE
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE
EXACERBATION.
PROBLEM LIST: 1. POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA.
2. LUMBAR DISK DISEASE.
3. HYPERTENSION.
4. COR PULMONALE.
5. TOBACCO SMOKER.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62 year old woman
with a history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease who presented to the Emergency Ward
with a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. She was
intubated for somnolence and worsening respiratory acidosis , and
transferred to the MICU. She had never had any intubations
previously. She is an active smoker with a long history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease who is followed by Dr. Jerald Fenner
Most recently , she was admitted on 8/5/92 for a chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation which was treated with
aggressive bronchodilators. Her baseline ABG on discharge was
7.39 , pC02 51.1 , and a p02 of 66 with 91.3% 02 saturation. She had
a previous sleep apnea study on 5/25 which was negative. Her
most recent thyroid function tests on 8/6 revealed an FEV1 of 38%
and an FVC of 51% , with an FEV1/FVC of less than 80%. This was
felt to be consistent with a mixed obstructive/restrictive pattern.
She has been treated with Theophylline and Proventil as well as
home nebulizers , Lasix , and 02 overnight. She continues to smoke
as well as noted above. She has had frequent episodes of cough and
productive sputum as well as lower extremity edema. She now
presents with one to two weeks of increase in her postnasal drip ,
denying any change in her cough or sputum production although she
did note a slightly increased temperature. She began to become
more short of breath and was taken to the Emergency Ward by her
sister. There , she was found to be cyanotic with an 02 saturation
of 59%. Her first blood gas on 50% was 7.27 , pCO2 79 , p02 78%
saturation after one nebulizer treatment. Her peak flows after
three nebulizers were only 90. She began to become somnolent with
a repeat blood gas showing a pCO2 of 94 , and was therefore
intubated and transferred to the MICU. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Was
remarkable for ( 1 ) asthma/COPD , ( 2 ) polymyalgia rheumatica , ( 3 )
borderline hypertension , ( 4 ) lumbar disk disease , ( 5 ) psoriasis ,
( 6 ) right sided heart failure , ( 7 ) spinal stenosis , ( 8 ) sinusitis ,
( 9 ) obesity. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Status post cholecystectomy
in 1979 , status post back surgery. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Theo-Dur 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d. , KCL , Lodine 300
mg p.o. b.i.d. , Proventil nebulizers p.r.n. , supplemental 02 q.h.s.
ALLERGIES: SHE IS ALLERGIC TO SULFA WHICH CAUSES HER TO HAVE A
RASH. HABITS: She continues to smoke , and she has a history of 40
pack years. There is no alcohol use. SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives
alone. She has two sons. She is assisted by her sister.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , she was an intubated , obese
female in no acute distress. Her blood
pressure was 140/70 , pulse 70-100 , and temperature of 101.6. HEENT
was unremarkable. Neck: Supple with no jugular venous distention.
Lungs revealed diffuse wheezes with an I:E ratio of 1:4. Heart:
Tachycardiac with a normal S1 , S2 , without murmurs , rubs , or
gallops. Breasts: No masses. Abdomen: Obese , mild tenderness to
deep palpation , normal bowel sounds. Extremities: 2+ edema to her
calves bilaterally , no clubbing. Pulses were 2+ dorsalis pedis
pulses. On neurological exam , she was awake but lethargic and
difficult to arouse , but was able to move all extremities. Her
reflexes were 2+ and symmetric bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , sodium 138 , potassium 4.4 , chloride
98 , bicarbonate 36 , BUN 10 , creatinine 0.6 ,
glucose 113. Her liver function tests were within normal limits.
Her white count was 9.96 , 76 polys , 15 lymphs. Her hematocrit was
47.6% with 265 , 000 platelets. The PT was 11.4 , and the PTT was
30.5. Theophylline level was 5.3. ABG's were as mentioned above.
Post intubation , ABG 7.45 , pCO2 41 , p02 57 , with 91% saturation.
The most recent echocardiogram in 1/11 revealed mild concentric
left ventricular hypertrophy and normal left ventricular function.
The chest x-ray revealed an increased heart size with no
infiltrates. The urinalysis revealed too numerous to count white
blood cells and 4+ bacteria. Cultures eventually grew out E. coli.
EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm with an axis of +8 , right bundle
branch block , inverted T's in V1 and V2 , but no significant change
compared with 11/1
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and continued on the
ventilator until 3/6/93. She was given aggressive
bronchodilator treatment via nebulizers , Albuterol and Atropent.
She was started on IV Solu-Medrol dose which was rapidly tapered on
a p.o. schedule. She also received two days of IV Ceftriaxone to
cover a possible tracheobronchitis. She was also continued on her
Ancef as well. Her urinary tract infection was treated via the
Ceftriaxone. She did well over the next two days and essentially
was ready for extubation on this regimen on 3/6/93. She was
watched overnight and did continue to do well , and was transferred
to the floor on 6/14/93. By this time , her 02 saturations were 92%
on two liters. She was afebrile , and her peak flows were improving
with continued Albuterol nebulizers and Atrovent inhaler. Her
polymyalgia rheumatica remained stable during her admission. There
was a question whether or not her urinary tract infection was
adequately treated as she had several repeat cultures growing 5 , 000
colonies of Staph aureus and one also growing diphtheroids. These
were clean catches. She had it repeated one more time as a clean
catch , and this was found to grow probable Pseudomonas species ,
with an exact speciation pending. This last culture on 5/17/93 was
associated with an urinalysis that was without white cells. Because
of this and because of the low cell count , I did not feel that it
was necessary to treat the positive culture until a straight cath
specimen was obtained. The patient was informed that if her
dysuria were to persist that she was to call Dr. Gigger immediately ,
but that otherwise , her urine was most likely noninfected. She
also received a sleep study on 1/16/93 which revealed that her
oxygen saturations dropped to 46% during REM sleep. This was at a
point when she appeared not to be breathing , and therefore had an
element of essential sleep apnea. She also during periods of
non-REM sleep alternated between breathing against an obstruction
and not breathing at all. This revealed that she also has a
component of obstructive sleep apnea as well. She was started on
Progesterone as an outpatient and will continue to be followed for
evaluation for possible nasal C-PAP. The patient was discharged on
8/19/93 with a continued good airflow and much fewer wheezes than
previously. There were no complications.
