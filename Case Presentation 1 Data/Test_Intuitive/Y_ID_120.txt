ATTENDING: RUCKEL , KENDALL M.D.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
In brief , this is a 64-year-old male with a history of CAD , CHF
with an EF of 25% on a prior echo with a inferior hypokinesis ,
PE , DVT on Coumadin , morbid obesity , with OSA , chronic renal
insufficiency , who presented with fever , hematuria , dysuria , and
right back pain , admitted for urosepsis requiring vasopressin for
blood pressure support. The patient was admitted to the Medical
ICU. Initially , did not respond to vasopressor regimen and
unclear relative contribution of distributive verus cardiogenic
shock. Electively intubated in an anticipation of procedures
given body habitus. Swan numbers were consistent with
distributive shock in addition to urosepsis with E. coli and
urine culture and sputum culture. The patient also had evidence
of prostatitis and acalculous cholecystitis , status post biliary
drain with E. coli , received desensitization for ceftriaxone for
quinolone-resistant E. coli. The patient improved on antibiotic
regimen , off pressors and continued to have daily fevers , now off
all antibiotics. The patient was trached for obstructive sleep
apnea , now tolerating trache collar and able to take p.o.

VNA services at home , is a nonsmoker , and history of alcohol
abuse.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Significant for mother with diabetes and father with hypertension
and alcoholism.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
A morbidly obese African-American male trached in no acute
distress. Pupils were equally , round , and reactive to light.
His oropharynx is clear with moist mucous membranes. His chest
has vented breath sounds. His heart is S1 and S2 , tachycardic
with no murmurs , rubs , or gallops , sometimes irregularly
irregular. His abdomen is obese with a gallbladder drain , soft ,
nontender , and nondistended. His extremities are warm and well
perfused with 2+ pitting edema to the knees bilaterally. Skin ,
he had healing vesicles on his nose and lips.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
ID: The patient with septic shock secondary to urosepsis and
acalculous cholecystitis secondary to quinolone-resistant E.
coli. He had a desensitization protocol for ceftriaxone to treat
E. coli , completed a 14-day course of ceftriaxone for urosepsis.
He had a biliary drain placed to decompress gallbladder on
11/6/05 .  A right upper quadrant ultrasound without dilated
ducts. This will stay in place for six weeks. Also , received a
14-day course of vancomycin for empiric coverage after 8/30/05
coag-negative Staph from the line. This was continued , as the
patient continued to be febrile. Other surveillance cultures
were negative. Vesicular lesions on 11/6/05 on the nose and
lips , received a seven-day course of acyclovir. While patient's
white blood cells count trending down and hemodynamically stable ,
continued to have daily fevers , usually spiking in the afternoon
and then defervescing without medication throughout the day.
LENIs on 5/26/05 showed no new DVTs , although limited due to
patient's body habitus. The patient's galactomannan was
negative. Both arterial line and central line changed 2/4/05 ,
eventually taken out. Fevers felt to be due to antibiotics , now
off all antibiotics with gradual resolution of fevers. ENT
evaluated for sinusitis. No
sinusitis on 10/10/05 .  The patient's LFTs were within normal
limits. Chest x-ray is clear. Sputum culture was notable for
yeast. Body habitus prevents chest , abdominal , and pelvic CT
scan.
2. Pulmonary: The patient was trached due to extensive soft
tissue and concern for airway collapse. The patient tolerating
trach with decreased secretions when started on glycopyrrolate ,
and the patient's trache tube was changed on 4/19/05 to a
Bivona #7.
3. Cardiovascular: The patient with known CAD , on beta-blocker ,
consider restarting aspirin , once therapeutic on Coumadin. The
patient has known ACE inhibitor allergy. The patient's fasting
lipid profiles were within normal limits , not on the statin.
Pump: The patient had an echo on 2/4/05 that showed mild to
moderately reduced LV function. Unable to assess the ejection
fraction due to limited study from the size , severe posterior
lateral hypokinesis to akinesis and abnormal septal wall motion ,
moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Volume overloaded , diuresed
with Lasix , now euvolemic , autoregulating. Rate and rhythm: The
patient with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation ,
status post permanent pacemaker for bradycardia. EP increased
the rate of his pacemaker from 60-80 and the pacemaker rate
should be changed back to 60 with the Medtronic pacemaker.
4. Heme: The patient with a history of DVT , PE , now on Coumadin
with the therapeutic INR goal of 1.5 to 2.0. The history of GI
bleed. He has an IVC filter in place.
5. GI: Status post biliary drain for acalculous cholecystitis
to remain for a total of six weeks by Interventional Radiology
placed on 11/6/05 .
6. Renal: Acute and chronic renal failure resolved after
sepsis. Creatinine at baseline after diuresing post ATN. Renal
ultrasound within normal limits.
7. Endo: Continued on home dose Levoxyl for hypothyroidism.
Became , hyponatremic , hyperkalemic , which resolved on its own.
Cort-stim within normal limits.
8. FEN: The patient is status post trache refusing OG/NG tube.
Speech and Swallow felt that the patient would tolerate p.o. and
advanced diet as tolerated.
9. PPX: The patient on Coumadin with an elevated INR and proton
pump inhibitor. The patient is a full code.
