Discharge Date: 10/24/1992
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Asthma exacerbation.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 2. Coronary artery disease.
3. Chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.
4. Sleep apnea.
5. Hypertension.
6. Obesity.
7. Tobacco history.
HISTORY: A 61-year-old female with a long tobacco
history of COPD , and recently diagnosed
sleep apnea is admitted with an asthma flare. In 1981 , she had a
DVT which required IVC filter placement. In 1983 , she had a
nonQ-wave MI and cath at that time showed an 80% proximal LAD
stenosis , 30% RCA stenosis treated medically. In October of 1991 ,
the patient had an exercise test in which she went four minutes
in 28 seconds , stopped because of fatigue and there were no
diagnostic EKG changes. PFT's at that time were reportedly
normal , although details are not available at this time.
In July of 1991 , further evaluation of the patient's dyspnea
included multiple normal EKG's , a low probable VQ scan. She was
treated with steroids and inhalers ( Bronchosol ) with good relief.
In September 1991 , the patient had recurrent dyspnea on exertion. She
ruled out for an MI at Jeanes Medical Center . Repeat Cath
showed an LAD stenosis of 40% , RCA of 80% and an ejection
fraction of 73%. She was discharged on medical management.
In February of 1991 , the patient was diagnosed with "asthma"/COPD
and had another rule out MI for dyspnea. At that time , she had
another ETT in which she went four minutes and 45 seconds ,
stopped secondary to chest pain , however , the EKG was
nondiagnostic. Thallium showed fixed anterior defects ( although
the effects overlying breast tissue cannot be ruled out ).
Bronchoscopy showed mild bronchitis and , since that time , she was
discharged on a prednisone taper which had gradually been tapered
down to 11 mg a day.
Of note , the patient also has been diagnosed with sleep apnea for
which she is on nasal CPAP. She sleeps in a chair due to
orthopnea and occasionally has paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
The most recent pulmonary function tests ( January 1992 ) showed an
FEV1 of 1.76 , an FVC of 2.5 , ratio of 70% , DLCO of 28.3. A
twenty-four holter was negative for arrhythmias. Exercise test
at that time , she went nine minutes and had no ST changes.
Thallium images were again unremarkable.
One week prior to admission , the patient developed symptoms of
upper respiratory infection including sneezing , rhinorrhea ,
headache and had increased shortness of breath. Steroids were
increased as were nebulizers with symptomatic improvement. Over
the five days prior to admission , the patient had increasing
shortness of breath , wheezing worse at night. She denies fevers ,
chills , sweats , nausea , vomiting , chest pain , abdominal pain ,
cough , rash or joint pain.
In the Emergency Room , the patient was in marked respiratory
distress for which she was given nebulizer and begun on IV Solu-
Medrol. Peak flow at that time was 180.
Past medical history , COPD , coronary artery disease status post
nonQ-wave MI 1983. Obesity. Sleep apnea. Allergic rhinitis.
Status post cholecystectomy. Benign breast cyst resection.
History of labyrinthitis. History of Sjogren's disease with a
positive anti DNA antibody. History of DVT status post IVC
filter in 1983.
ALLERGIES: Sulfa has caused swollen mouth ,
Theophylline causes jitteriness.
MEDICATIONS: Albuterol nebulizers t.i.d.; Kay-Ciel
8 mEq q.d.; Prednisone 11 mg q.d.;
Guanfacine 600 mg b.i.d.; Verapamil 240 SR q.d.; Lasix 40 mg
b.i.d. ( q.d. if feels okay ). Cromolyn nebs q. 6 hours ( rarely
uses ); Nasobid inhaler b.i.d.; Ranitidine q. h.s. HABITS:
Tobacco history , quit approximately two years ago , rare alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Obese , pleasant female in mild shortness
of breath initially but responded to
nebs and steroids. Otopharynx was clear. There was no thrush.
NECK: Supple. Carotids 2+. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and
rhythm , very distant. LUNGS: Decreased breath sounds at bases ,
scant wheezes , no crackles. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender.
EXTREMITIES: Obese , no marked edema , although difficult to
assess secondary to obesity. SKIN: No visible lesion.
NEUROLOGICAL: Grossly within normal limits.
LABORATORY DATA: Potassium 3.6 , BUN 16 , creatinine 0.9 ,
white count 15.1 , urinalysis negative.
Chest X-ray , no significant disease except for a question of mild
CHF changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was treated with IV
steroids , nebulizers , oxygen , and did
quite well. The trigger for her asthma remains illusive. She
underwent an esophageal acid study to rule out subclinical
aspiration ( results pending at the time of discharge ). There was
no infectious component to her exacerbation detected , although
preceding viral illness cannot be excluded. The patient was
treated with subcutaneous Heparin for DVT risks.
On hospital day number four , the patient was converted to
Prednisone without complications. She had no episodes of chest
pain and there was no evidence for ischemic etiology.
At the time of discharge , the patient's peak flows were greater
than 500 and her lung exam had cleared remarkably. She is
transferred to Foflotroy Hospital for respiratory
rehabilitation on the following medications: Aspirin one tablet
p.o. q.d.; Atrovent puffers two puffs q. 4 hours; Beconase nasal
inhaler two puffs q. 6 hours; Heparin 10 , 000 units subcutaneous
b.i.d.; Pepcid 20 mg q. h.s.; Prednisone 40 mg p.o. q. d. ( taper
as tolerated ); Albuterol nebulized treatments q. 4 hours as
needed; Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.; Verapamil SR 240 mg p.o. q.d.;
Lasix 40 mg p.o. q. a.m. p.r.n.; Beclovent neb six puffs p.o.
q.i.d.
ADDENDUM:
Regarding the patient's esophagram results , the patient had a
48-hour esophageal pH monitor which showed that the patient has
reflux episodes and parameters which are within normal limits;
however , 4/7 cough episodes are correlated with the patient's
cough and asthma flares are possibly related to her reflux
symptoms; however , the study was not completely diagnostic.
Benefit from anti-reflux medications such as Reglan on a
diagnostic and therapeutic trial , we should also consider further
gastroesophageal reflux studies such as manometry as an
outpatient.
