Discharge Date: 10/15/2005
ATTENDING: BABILONIA , HARRISON LENARD HILARIO
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
Graft versus host disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient in 1/25 developed right breast cancer , stage III.
Treatment included lumpectomy and chemotherapy. The patient had
persistent pancytopenia , which was evaluated in 10/4 with bone
marrow aspirate biopsy , which showed multiple cytogenetic
abnormalities with findings consistent with myelodysplastic
syndrome. In 8/14 , she had a nonmyeloblative peripheral blood
stem cell transplant for a match unrelated donor. In 10/18 , she
had lymphocyte infusion. On 5/8 , chimerism study showed 58%
donor origin. Repeat chimerism on 8/23/05 showed 100%
chimerism. The patient prior to admission for two weeks had
diarrhea , watery in nature. She denied sick contacts , had GI
biopsy in middle of 5/24 that showed focal colitis , without
signs of GVHD. The patient was given prescription for steroids
three days prior to admission , but did not complete or fill the
prescription , was admitted from the clinic with significant skin
rash that was consistent with graft versus host disease.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Includes breast cancer in 1/25 , myelodysplastic syndrome ,
hypertension , and hypercholesterolemia. The patient had isolated
complicated migraine headache and has aortic valvular disease
with aortic insufficiency.
ALLERGIES:
She describes no allergies to medications.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
She is divorced with one son , denies alcohol or illicit drug
intake.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Noncontributory.
PHYSICAL FINDINGS:
On exam vital signs were stable. The patient had dry
maculopapular rash over the upper chest and face , also including
the upper extremities , abdomen , and upper thighs bilaterally ,
flat , slightly erythematous. HEENT exam was normal. She had dry
mucous membranes. Chest is clear to percussion and auscultation.
Cardiac exam: There is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard
best in the aortic area. Abdomen is soft and nontender. There
is no hepatosplenomegaly appreciated on clinical exam. She has
large external hemorrhoids. There is no clubbing , cyanosis , or
edema. Neurological exam is nonfocal.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Oncology: The patient has a history of MDS , 11 months status
post nonmyeloablative transplant. The patient was very slow to
engraft and required donor lymphocyte infusion. Most recent
chimerism studies on 8/23/05 showed a 100% donor origin. The
patient had stage III skin GVH confirmed by biopsy on 6/15/05.
She had moderate improvement response to Solu-Medrol , which was
started on 8/5/05 ( switched to prednisone on 6/11/05 ) and
Elidel started on 5/22/05. There has been even more improvement
in the skin GVH since initiating rapamycin on 8/6
Gut GVH/diarrhea. GI biopsy done on 5/10/05 showed grade II
graft versus host disease in left transverse colon , grade I graft
versus host disease in rectum , with no viral cytopathic changes.
The patient had no significant decrease in the amount of stools
with Solu-Medrol , marginal response to rapamycin , now with some
improvement status post three doses of ONTAK. ONTAK was given on
6/17/05 , 9/6/05 , and 10/22/05 without adverse events. The
patient was premedicated with Pepcid , steroids , Benadryl , and
Tylenol. The only side effect is marked increase in left upper
extremity edema ( see cardiovascular section for more details ).
Solu-Medrol IV was started 2 mg/kg/day , started on 8/5/05 ,
changed to 2 mg/kg by mouth oral steroids on 6/13/05. Began
tapering with steroids at 100 mg b.i.d. on 11/18/05 , decreased to
80 mg on 8/20/05 , and down to 60 mg twice daily on 10/24/05.
Rapamycin was started on 10/10/05 , goal level between 3 and 12.
The patient has been therapeutic since initiating therapy. She
remains on GVH diet , coordinating with dietary and kitchen for
correct menu. She also has been on lactose-restricted diet that
has helped the stool volume as well.
2. Hematology: The patient with no active bleeding was
transfused for hematocrit less than 26 and platelets less than
20. She did have intermittent bright red blood and clots in
stool , most recently on 10/2/05 and 8/25/05. This was
attributed to have large hemorrhoids that were found on
colonoscopy. She remained hemodynamically stable throughout.
3. Infectious disease: The patient remained afebrile throughout
her hospitalization , maintained on prophylactic medication of
Mepron and acyclovir. Cytomegalovirus viral load on 2/7/05 ,
8/5/05 , 5/10/05 , and 10/10/05 , all negative. CMV viral load
on 9/6/05 was pending at the time of this dictation. The
patient is to remain on acyclovir and Mepron once transferred.
4. Cardiovascular: The patient remained hemodynamically stable ,
did not get hypotensive throughout the admission.
5. Extremities: The patient had left upper extremity swelling ,
markedly worsened , starting on tacrolimus , as this is known to
cause capillary leak syndrome due to an ultrasound of the left
upper extremity on 11/28/05 , which is negative for DVT. Etiology
is likely due to lymphedema secondary to axillary resection when
the patient had breast cancer and capillary leak syndrome
associated with ONTAK. The patient had an echocardiogram to
assess the etiology of peripheral edema , which showed an ejection
fraction of 60% , mild aortic insufficiency , and aortic stenosis ,
borderline diastolic dysfunction , normal right heart , and minimal
pericardial effusion.
6. Pulmonary: The patient had one episode of dyspnea when
speaking on 11/16/05 , which resolved without further symptoms
throughout the admission. The patient had chest x-ray on
10/6/05 , which showed small left pleural effusion without other
abnormalities.
7. Gastrointestinal: Mouth , the patient had dry mouth , likely a
component of graft versus host disease using ice chips and mouth
coat is helpful to her. She should continue this throughout.
8. Gut: The patient had persistent loose stools improved ( see
oncology section ). Clostridium difficile testing sent on
8/26/05 and 3/5/05 were negative. She had intermittent bright
red blood per rectum that was related to external hemorrhoids , as
stated above in GI section.
Colonoscopy on 5/10/05 revealed stage II GVHD on biopsy with no
gross visual evidence of bleed. As the fact now , the patient was
admitted on 7/16/05 with bright red blood. The colonoscopy was
notable for large hemorrhagic mucosa , intubating internal
hemorrhoids , and at that time biopsies were negative for graft
versus host disease. This was on 3/5/05. Liver transaminitis
on 8/29/05 , likely due to ONTAK would be followed as an
outpatient. The patient also had transient LFT abnormalities
when first admitted and has since resolved since discontinuing
Bactrim. The bilirubin remained normal. The patient was
asymptomatic.
9. Rectum: The patient had Anusol as needed for hemorrhoids.
She was not a candidate for surgical intervention due to
immunosuppression and infection risk.
10. Renal: The patient repeated increasing creatinine to 1.3.
She maintained a level of 0.9 to 1.2 throughout the last few
weeks before discharge.
11. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient has marked
peripheral edema. Diureses worked well. The patient was up to
18 kg above admit weight and now she is only 3 kg up from the
admit weight on 10/24/05. She is on Lasix 40 mg twice daily by
mouth. This is likely secondary to combination to venous
insufficiency , steroids , and low albumin. In the setting of
ONTAK , she was given albumin and Lasix three times daily , which
is no longer needed now that she that would not be pursuing ONTAK
therapy until an outpatient attending decides , otherwise. She
should have a goal I/O negative to 1 to 1.5 liters a day.
Monitor hemodynamics closely if the patient has been noted to be
dehydrated. Encouraged ambulation and for elevation we were
using Ace bandage like wraps. The patient had electrolytes
monitored and repleaded as needed. Nutrition was following.
12. Endocrine: The patient's fingerstick blood sugars were 134
and 163 , improved since steroids taper initiated. She remained
on the sliding scale as needed , likely this is due to steroids.
13. Dermatology: The patient upon admission had significant
involvement of skin due to GVH greater than 80% body surface area
involved. It is improved significantly , as the exam revealed
less erythema , darkening rash , and decreased distribution. The
patient is on GVH medication , as stated in Oncology section. She
also came in with macerated areas under both breast and was
treated with miconazole powder and had improved by the day of
discharge.
14. Access: The patient had double lumen Hickman catheter ,
which is erythematous surrounding exit site. The cuff has been
exposed for months , although the patient has had no fevers , not
tender , outpatient attending requested to keep it lying in.
