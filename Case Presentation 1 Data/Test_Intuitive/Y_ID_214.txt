***HOSPITAL COURSE****
78 yo man ext CAD , AFIB now presenting w CHF , mod rapid AFIB and tnI leak.
Likely CHF in setting of rapid AFIB and demand ischemia from progression
of CAD.
1. CV- ischemia- peak TnI 0.29 and trended down , CK+MB flat. Dobutamine
MIBI showed reversible defect in Lcx territory. Cont current med mgmt:
asa , statin , lopressor , cozaar. Cardiac catheterization on 10/28/05 showed
showed aortic stenosis of 33.8mmHg , calculated AVA 0.83cm. Mean PACPW of
23. Left main coronary artery and 3 vessel disease s/p bypass grafts seen.
Hazy eccentric proximal LM 70% stenosis , LAD occuluded after 2 large
septal branches , ramus intermedius and Lcx without obstructive stenosis.
RCA totally occluded. Left subclavian stent patent without gradient. LIMA
patent w/20% ostial stenosis. SVG to PDA patent w/80% ostial in stent
restenosis and mid SVG 30% eccentric stenosis. Thus 2/3 grafts patent.
Cypher DES placed in SVG to PDA w/TIMI 3 flow. Left main coronary artery
also stented with Cypher DES w/TIMI 3 flow. Pt should be on Aspirin
indefinitely and plavix 3 months minimum.
