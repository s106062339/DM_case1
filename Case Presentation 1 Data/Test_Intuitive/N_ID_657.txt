HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Eric Christinsen is a 79-year-old gentleman with extensive history of
coronary artery disease who has previously undergone a coronary
artery bypass graft x2. Also , several percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasties and stents of his saphenous vein graft to
his first diagonal coronary artery in 1999. He also received a
stent to his left subclavian due to total occlusion and a stent
and angioplasty of the left brachial artery. He has a history of
atrial fibrillation , chronic renal failure , peripheral vascular
disease. He is also status post bilateral carotid
endarterectomies as well as a longstanding history of
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The patient recently had
been experiencing increasing shortness of breath , dyspnea on
exertion , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and more frequent episodes
of substernal chest pressure. Aortic valve area had reached the
value of 0.4 cm2. During her previous admission in September 2005 ,
he underwent cardiac catheterization , which revealed left main
coronary artery disease and three vessels with evidence of
restenosis. At that time , he underwent successful stenting to
his left main coronary artery and a successful PTCA and stenting
two saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending coronary
artery. Echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 50% ,
aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 23 mmHg , a peak gradient
of 38 mmHg , calculated valve area of 0.8 cm2 , trivial aortic
insufficiency , mild mitral insufficiency , and moderate tricuspid
insufficiency.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY/PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
Significant for myocardial infarction in 1999 , history of class
IV heart failure with inability to carry on any physical
activity , recent signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure
including paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , dyspnea on exertion ,
pulmonary edema on chest x-ray , and pedal edema. He is status
post a coronary artery bypass graft x4 in 1989 with the left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary
artery , saphenous vein graft to the first diagonal coronary
artery , saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending coronary
artery , saphenous vein graft to the third obtuse marginal
coronary artery and also reoperation in 1992 for coronary artery
bypass graft x2 with a saphenous vein graft to the posterior
descending coronary artery , and saphenous vein graft to left
circumflex coronary artery. He is also status post a PTCA and
atherectomy in 1996 and 1997 and stent placement in 1999 and most
recently as stated above he has history of hypertension ,
peripheral vascular disease , claudication bilaterally with
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The patient is also status
post a right fem-pop bypass. He has a history of dyslipidemia ,
renal failure status post left carotid endarterectomy and right
carotid endarterectomy , peripheral vascular angioplasty to the
left subclavian and left brachial arteries , a peripheral vascular
stent placement of the left subclavian and left brachial
arteries. He is status post a cholecystectomy and hernia repair.

ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA:
Sodium of 141 , potassium 3.7 , chloride of 106 , CO2 29 , BUN of 45 ,
creatinine 1.5 , glucose of 88 , magnesium 1.9. WBC 6.02 ,
hematocrit 27.2 , hemoglobin 8.4 , platelets of 239 , 000. PT of 36
and PT/INR of 3.6.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Alex Chumley was brought to the operating room on 1/14/05 where he
underwent an elective reoperation aortic valve replacement with a
23 mm Mosaic valve. Total bypass time was 119 minutes , total
crossclamp time was 69 minutes. Intraoperatively , the patient
was cannulated via the right axillary artery and left femoral
vein. A sternotomy was performed while on coronary pulmonary
bypass without incident. He was found to have a trileaflet
calcified aortic valve , which was excised after transverse
aortotomy. The patient did well intraoperatively , came off
bypass without incident , was brought up to the Intensive Care
Unit in normal sinus rhythm and stable condition.
Postoperatively , the patient did very well. He was extubated and
transferred to Step-Down Unit on postoperative day #1. He did
receive transfusion of 2 units packed red blood cells for
postoperative anemia. His Plavix , aspirin and Coumadin was
restarted for his atrial fibrillation. Heath Uren was also found
to have an air leak from his chest tube and also did begin to
have some postoperative confusion on postoperative day #2. His
narcotics were discontinued. His chest tube air leak resolved ,
and the chest tubes were removed without incident. Post-pull
chest x-ray showed no pneumothorax. On postoperative day #3 , the
patient continued with his confusion requiring a sitter.
Psychiatry was consulted and recommended to restart his
preoperative benzodiazepine and Haldol in the evening. He was
also seen by the Infectious Disease Service for shingles and
was started on a seven-day course of acyclovir for
post-herpetic neuralgia. He required vigorous diuresis and
pulmonary toilet with Mucomyst and vigorous chest physical
therapy. The patient's mental status cleared. He no longer
required a sitter. He was screened by rehab and was accepted for
transfer to rehab on postoperative day #11. The patient also
received additionally a unit of packed red blood cells for
hematocrit of 23 with good result. Isaias Sellars was also started on
Lovenox on 4/4/05 as a bridge to Coumadin until his INR
increases to 2.0 for his atrial fibrillation , atrial flutter.
