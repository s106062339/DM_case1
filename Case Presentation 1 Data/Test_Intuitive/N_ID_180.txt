Discharge Date: 5/10/2002
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: 1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
2. AORTIC STENOSIS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 55-year-old female
with a history of coronary artery
disease , congestive heart failure and chronic renal insufficiency
who presented with substernal chest pain on April , 2002 to the
Devill Medical Center .  She was admitted by the
emergency department to the Cardiology Service and work-up revealed
aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension , peripheral
vascular disease , bilateral lower extremity
claudication , insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ,
hypercholesterolemia , renal failure after her catheterization in
2001 with her creatinine running in the high 2.0 to 3.0 range ,
congestive heart failure. The patient has had a previous stent to
the LAD and circumflex in 1999. She has also had a myocardial
infarction in 1998 associated with prolonged chest pain and has a
history of class 3 angina and class 3 heart failure.
ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to intravenous dye. She
developed renal failure to this. She has no other
known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , amlodipine
10 mg p.o. q. day , Isordil 30 mg p.o.
t.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day , Lasix 160 mg p.o. b.i.d. , NPH
insulin 20 units q. PM and 40 units q. AM , Epogen 2 , 000 q. day and
Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: The patient is a well-developed ,
well-nourished female in no acute distress.
HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation.
ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender , non-distended. EXTREMITIES: She had
bilateral varicosities and she is status post amputations of two
toes. Her pulses to her lower extremities were intact , but faint.
LABORATORY: Cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% circumflex
lesion , 100% right coronary artery occlusion and the
circumflex was subsequently stented. An echocardiogram performed
showed a 40% ejection fraction with aortic stenosis , a peak
gradient of 35 and a calculated valve area of 1 cm squared.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating room on
August , 2002 for an aortic valve replacement
with a St. Jude #23 mechanical valve and a coronary artery bypass
grafting x 3 to the LAD , obtuse marginal and LVB1. The patient
tolerated this procedure well and was transferred to the intensive
care unit for close monitoring. However , the patient did develop
an uncontrolled left-sided nose bleed in the operating room and ENT
was called to pack the nose. The postoperative course was
remarkable for sluggish urine output for which Renal consult was
called in to follow. The patient was treated with diuretics and
her urine output subsequently improved. The patient was kept on
pressors and mechanical ventilation for several days and was then
extubated on January , 2002 after her volume overload was
controlled. The patient was transferred to the floor on July ,
2002 off her torsemide drip and tolerating intravenous intermittent
doses of torsemide. Otolaryngology removed the packing from the
patient's nose and she just had minor oozing after this not
requiring any treatment. Both Cardiology and Renal continued to
follow throughout the patient's hospital course and by May ,
2002 , the patient was tolerating a regular diet , urinating well
with oral antidiuretics and without subsequent nose bleeds. It was
decided that the patient was ready to be discharged to
rehabilitation at this point.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Tylenol , aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day ,
Dulcolax and Colace p.r.n. , Epogen
10 , 000 units subcutaneously q. week , Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , NPH

units q. AM , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Ocean Spray q.i.d. ,
Coumadin p.o. q. day and she should have her Coumadin adjusted

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged in good
condition.

primary care physician within one week and her cardiologist within
one to three weeks. Ohacli Hospital Medical Center is aware of
the plans and is helping in arranging follow up appointments.
