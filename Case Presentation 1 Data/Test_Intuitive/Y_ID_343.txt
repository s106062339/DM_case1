HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
--CV:
1. ) [I] -- Unlikely ACS ( no suspicious ECG changes , no rise in enz ).
Cont'd ASA , CCB , BB , ARB , restarted statin ( Pravastatin ) , and ezetimibe
for LDL at 140.
2. ) [P] -- EF 35% on 4/6 MIBI , now 30% on echo. CHF and volume
overloaded. Responded well to diuresis w/ IV Lasix. Was transitioned to
PO Lasix. Fluid restricted to < 2L. Repeat CXR was significantly
improved , and edema lessened as well.
3. ) [R] -- AF w/ RVR , rate controlled on BB but was still sometimes in
low 100s. Given this the decision to start amiodarone was made and pt
tolerated this well. Still in Afib on discharge , but rate in 80s. Pt
will f/u w/ Dr. Kaewprasert ( outpt cardiologist ) in 4-6 weeks. If still in
Afib will consider electrically cardioverting.
--PULM: OSA on CPAP at home. Cont'd CPAP in house. Pt transitioned from
NC to RA on HD 3.
--HEME/ID: Blood/Urine cx neg. Stopped Abx after one dose of Levoflox in
ED. UA 2+ protein. Did not seem clinically infected given CXR
resolution of questionable opacity post-diuresis. On Coumadin at home ,
INR initially 3.3 , so Coumadin was held. Restarted when <3.0. Cont home
Coumadin for goal INR 2.0-3.0.
--FEN/GI: ADA diet. Elevated LFTs ( Bili 1.3 ) ( likely from heart failure
backup ) now resolved.
--RENAL: Cr 1.6 baseline. Pt's Cr was as high as 1.9.
--ENDO: A1C was 5.7. Patient's outpt glyburide was discontinued while in
hospital given renal dysfxn. Insulin basal and SS was started and
titrated. Pt will return to Glyburide and daily fingersticks at home.
Will recommend switching to glipizide , but will defer to PCP.
--NEURO/PAIN: Tylenol prn. No issues.
--PROPHY: PPI , coumadin
--GU: BPH --
finasteride

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Hello Mr. Lockner , it was a pleasure taking care of you while you were in
the hospital. As you know , you were diagnosed with heart failure and
atrial fibrillation. We helped you by getting rid of some excess fluid
from your lungs , and slowed your heart rate down. We also started you on
an antiarrhythmic ( amiodarone ) to try to convert you into sinus rhythm.
After discharge please continue taking your amiodarone. Also please
following these instructions: 1. ) Weigh yourself daily ( your current
weight is 200 pounds ). If you gain significant weight , especially within
one or two days ( e.g. >3-5 pounds ) this may be fluid building up in your
lungs. Please call your doctor. 2. ) Please taking measures to stop
smoking. 3. ) Please check your blood sugar everyday in the morning before
breakfast and record these values for your doctor. 4. ) Please see an
opthalmologist within 1-2 months for a check-up. 5. ) Please take Lasix 80
mg twice a day. 6. ) Please continue taking ezetimibe and pravastatin for
your cholesterol control. 7. ) Please see your primary care doctor , your
renal doctor , and your heart doctor soon. 8. ) Please take 6 mg Coumadin a
night and get your INR checked at the Free Medical Center Coumadin clinic on 7/11/06 .
They will then instruct you to change your dose accordingly. Your goal
INR is 2-3.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Satisfactory
TO DO/PLAN:
1. ) Cardiology -- consider electric cardioversion in 4-6 weeks if still
not in sinus rhythm on amiodarone. Please check LFTs , PFTs , TFTs ( last
value 10/15/06 nl )
2. ) Primary care -- titrate hypoglycemics -- consider switching from
glyburide to glipizide given renal dyxfxn?
3. ) Coumadin -- goal INR 2-3 to be managed at SBMH coumadin clinic.
