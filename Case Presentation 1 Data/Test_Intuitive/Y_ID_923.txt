HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
Impression: 62F w/ SLE , CAD , h/o disseminated VZV , seizure d/o here w/
herpetic whitlow and bacterial superinfection/cellulitis.
1. ID/Cellultis overlying herpetic whitlow--Pt's infection appeared to be
markedly improved from ED presentation at time of evaluation by admitting
Medicine team. However , given h/o SLE and prednisone use , making Pt
functionally immunosupressed , indication for conservative management w/
admission and observation reasonable. Per record , Pt does not have
official Dx of DM2--?elevated Gluc in past 2/2 steroid use. Pt very
resistant to staying in hospital , as she felt her finger was much
improved , pain completely resolved , margins all receeded from marked
borders at admission , no f/c , no joint pain. Reviewed Ortho hand recs ,
plan w/ Medicine attending and Pt. As Pt displayed excellent understanding
of Dx , indications for return to hospital , and desire for adherence ,
agreed to d/c her home from the ED w/ oral Clindamycin 450 mg po qid and
close f/u in LOMU MEDICAL CENTER w/ PCP on 10/17 Given a final dose of Clinda 600
mg IV before d/c. Decision made not to provide Rx for herpetic whitlow at
the present time given Pt's many allergies and brief literature review ,
which notes controversy over acyclovir Rx , given that most cases resolve
spontaneously in 2-3 wks. Pt to readdress at PCP visit.
