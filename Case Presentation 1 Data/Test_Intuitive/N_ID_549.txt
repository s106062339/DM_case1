Discharge Date: 8/10/2005
ATTENDING: LEIFER , JEFFEREY GRAHAM MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: Endocarditis , urinary tract infection.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Mitral regurgitation , diabetes ,
hypertension , congestive heart failure , recurrent UTIs , uterine
prolapse , hyperlipidemia , hiatal hernia , right breast nodule.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 76-year-old with a
history of severe mitral regurgitation , history of congestive
heart failure with an ejection fraction of 60% in 6/8 , chronic
abdominal discomfort , history of recurrent UTIs , and uterine
prolapse , who one week prior to admission developed increased
nausea , decreased appetite , weakness , fatigue and increased low
back pain. No vomiting , diarrhea , cough , or dysuria. On
presentation , the patient was found to be hypotensive , in septic
shock , with bacteremia in urinary tract infection and admitted to
the Medical ICU for pressure support.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Notable for heart rate of 94 ,
blood pressure of 80-90/50. Notable for heart exam with regular
rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , with 3/6 systolic crescendo
murmur and decrescendo murmur at the right upper sternal border
radiating to the clavicles and carotids , and 3/6 holosystolic
murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla , and an apical heave.
JVP flat. Chest with crackles in the right middle lung fields and
leg basilar crackles. Abdominal exam was benign. Guaiac
negative. Extremities with no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema and
1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
RELEVANT STUDIES AND TESTS: Blood culture on 10/13
Streptococcus viridans , levofloxacin sensitive , penicillin MIC
0.19. Urine culture on 10/13 Greater than 100 , 000 Klebsiella
pneumoniae , ampicillin resistant , gentamicin sensitive , and
levofloxacin sensitive. TEE on 10/17 Severe mitral
regurgitation , posterior leaflet with mitral calcifications and
linear density concerning for endocarditis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
IMPRESSION: A 76-year-old female with mitral regurgitation ,
history of CHF , history of recurrent UTI , who presented with
nausea and chills , had hypotension requiring a medical ICU stay x
2 days , with Streptococcus viridans bacteremia and mitral
calcifications in linear density concerning for endocarditis plus
Klebsiella UTI.
1. Infectious disease: The patient presented with chills and
hypotension and was admitted to the MICU from the ED for
treatment of septic shock. Her mean arterial pressures were kept
above 65 with Levophed. She initially was treated with
levofloxacin and vancomycin to treat Gram-positive cocci
bacteremia and UTI. Blood culture from 5/15 , grew out
Streptococcus viridans , levofloxacin sensitive , penicillin MIC
0.19. Urine culture was positive for Klebsiella , ampicillin
resistant , gentamicin and levofloxacin sensitive. On 1/11 ,
antibiotics were changed to penicillin 3 million units IV q.4h.
and gentamicin 50 mg IV q.8h. ATEE on 5/29 showed severe mitral
regurgitation with posterior leaflet calcifications and linear
density concerning for endocarditis. Therefore , a PICC line was
placed on 10/11 for continuation of a six-week course of
penicillin 3 million units IV q.4h. until 1/3 and two-week
course of gentamicin 50 mg IV q.8h. until 9/12 .  She will follow
up in the Infectious Disease Clinic with Dr. Ramiro Halcom on
1/5/05 at 8 a.m.
2. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: The patient was maintained on
aspirin. Lipitor was initially helped for an initial
transaminitis presumed to be secondary to shock liver , that at
the time of discharge her liver enzymes had normalized and she
was restarted on her Lipitor. Pump: The patient has a history
of congestive heart failure , with an ejection fraction 60% in
6/8 .  She had hypotension , requiring Levophed until 2/5 .  She
had an episode of flash pulmonary edema on 6/16 in the setting
of fluid bolus and one unit of packed red blood cells. She has a
very attenuatus balance between preload dependence and overload.
Her Lasix and ACE-I were held while she was hypotensive. Because
her systolic blood pressure continued to be low in the 90s and
low 100s , attempt was not made to re-add the ACE while in the
hospital. It is anticipated that her cardiologist and outpatient
physicians will attempt to add the ACE back onto her medical
regimen for better afterload reduction as her blood pressure
tolerates. The patient also has a very severe mitral
regurgitation , which would be one of the reasons that an ACE on
her medication regimen would be beneficial. Rhythm: The patient
was maintained on telemetry , and was found to be a normal sinus
rhythm with ectopy , including short once of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia. She was started on Lopressor 12.5 mg
t.i.d. on 1/11 , and this was increased to 25 mg b.i.d. at
discharge , with her heart rates continuing to be between the 70s
and the 90s , however , with less episodes of ectopy. Her
electrolytes were also well repleted.
3. Gastrointestinal: The patient had evidence of shock liver
( 4/10 with an ALT of 135 , AST of 177 , alkaline phosphatase of
251 , and T bili of 1.7 ) that is now resolving. Lipitor was held ,
and was started as a transaminitis resolved. Non-contrast CT of
the abdomen showed biliary sludge and gallstones , no evidence of
acute cholecystitis. Right upper quadrant ultrasound confirmed
the CT findings. Colon cancer is a concern with the patient's
anemia being new since 5/8 .  Her last colonoscopy was in 2000 ,
and she will benefit from repeat colonoscopy as an outpatient.
She was continued on Nexium for prophylaxis. Heme: The patient
had guaiac positive stools in the medical ICU , her hematocrit was
stable around 33%. She has a microcytic anemia with an MCV of
79 , her iron studies ( iron of 10 , TIBC of 191 , ferritin is 744 )
suggesting anemia of chronic disease with possibly overlying iron
deficiency.
4. Endocrine: The patient had a normal random cortisol level of
35.3. She had an uncertain diagnosis of diabetes and was on the
Portland protocol in the medical ICU. Hemoglobin A1c , however ,
was 6.5. Therefore , she was maintained thereafter only on
insulin sliding scale and rarely required any coverage.
5. Prophylaxis: The patient was kept on Lovenox and Protonix.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg daily , iron sulfate 325 mg
daily , gentamicin sulfate 50 mg IV q.8h. until 9/12 for a
two-week course , penicillin G potassium 3 million units IV q.4h.
until 1/3 for a six-week course , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. ,
Caltrate plus D2 tablets p.o. daily , Lipitor 10 mg daily , and
Protonix 40 mg daily. The patient has not been restarted on her
home Lasix and lisinopril secondary to persistently low blood
pressures between the 90s and 100s. It is anticipated that
especially her Lisinopril and her Lasix will be added back on to
her medical regimen as her blood pressure tolerates. Given that
she was no longer on Lasix , she was also taken potassium
chloride.
DISPOSITION: The patient is to be discharged to rehabilitation
at Acanmingpeerra Virg Tantblu Medical Center in order to be able to get her antibiotic
therapy. She was discharged on stable condition.
PHYSICIANS FOLLOW-UP: The patient has been following follow-up
appointments:
1. Stress test in 2/6/05 at 3 p.m.
2. Dr. Gale Montante ( general cardiology ) on 7/10/05 at 10 a.m.
3. Dr. Ed Storti 3/22/05 at 12 p.m.
4. Dr. Stacey Koers ( infectious disease ) 1/5/05 at 8 a.m.
The patient will follow up regarding the success of her
antibiotic therapy. It is also anticipated that her cardiologist
will re-add back on her ACE for better afterload reduction as her
blood pressures tolerates , and potentially we will add her back
on to the Lasix as well. She will require weekly lab draws to
check her electrolytes and CBC while she is on the antibiotics.
CONSULTANTS: Infectious disease , Dr. Rupert Zenon , pager
number 55757.
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN: Dr. Abel Guignard .
The patient is full code. Her family is aware of the situation.
