Discharge Date: 5/16/1990
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 22 year old , gravida V para
0314 , at 24 weeks , now with severe
frontal headache and scintillations. Dating is by the last
menstrual period and an early ultrasound which placed her at
approximately 24 weeks. She presented with a three and a half day
history of severe frontal headaches with scintillations. There was
no relief with Tylenol , aspirin or Fioricet. She also stated she
had marked polydipsia for four days. She denied abdominal pain or
swelling. She has a history of preeclampsia with a previous twin
gestation. She does note fetal activity. At this juncture , I
should note that much of this history is as per patient and is
somewhat unreliable. PAST OBSTETRICAL HISTORY: C-section for
twins; previous C-section for singleton; history by patient of
preeclampsia. PAST HISTORY: Initially she admitted to no past
medical problems , however , upon reviewing her chart the following
is obvious: chronic hypertension; seizure disorder following motor
vehicle accident for which she is on valproic acid , no clearly
documented recent seizures; history of asthma for which she takes
medicines p.r.n.; history of behavioral disorders with question of
pseudoseizures in the past; obesity; multiple drug allergies;
cholecystectomy in 1990; appendectomy at age 14; motor vehicle
accident with V-P shunt placement in 1980; facial reconstruction
times three in 1980; superficial vascular surgery in 1989 for
varicosities of the lower extremities. SOCIAL HISTORY: She denies
tobacco , ethanol or drug use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed an obese white female in mild
distress. The pupils are equal , round and
reactive to light and accommodation; fundi well visualized , no
papilledema. Good facial movements. No oral lesions. The chest
was clear. The heart showed a regular rate and rhythm. The
abdomen was soft and nontender with a fetal heart rate in the
140's. The extremities showed trace edema. The neuro exam showed
cranial nerves II-XII grossly intact. Reflexes were 1+ without
clonus. The strength was reduced to 4/5 in the right upper and
right lower extremities , however , the exam was questionable as she
seemed to have a varying exam depending on the examiner and time of
exam. She also demonstrated decreased fine finger movements on the
right.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Problem #1 ) Headache. The patient has a history
of chronic headaches for which she was maintained
on Fioricet in the past. Over the first week of hospitalization ,
she complained of increasing headache that prevented her from
looking into the light as well as prevented her from ambulating out
of the bed. At times , she complained of intermittent visual
symptoms. These headaches were not completely relieved by Demerol ,
Percocet or Tylenol. She was eventually tried on Fioricet which
apparently produced good relief of the headaches. She was seen by
neurology and noted with a questionably abnormal neuro exam with
findings localized to the right side. Apparently she has a history
of this abnormality in the past. A CT scan revealed what was
apparently old damage from the previous motor vehicle accident. An
MRI was entirely within normal limits. She refused a lumbar
puncture. At this time , the headaches are thought to be either
vascular in origin or psychogenic. She was continued on Fioricet
at the time of discharge. Problem #2 ) Hypertension. She had
elevated blood pressures of 150-160 over as high as 110 upon
admission. She has a history of chronic hypertension in the past
and was at least briefly maintained on hydrochlorothiazide before.
She had a negative work up for PET , including repeat 24 hour urines
and repeat PET labs. As well , she had no physical findings
consistent with PET. Given her history of chronic hypertension , we
felt this was most likely chronic hypertension aggravated by
pregnancy. She was begun on a beta blocker , namely labetolol , with
good control. She was discharged to home on labetolol. Problem
#3 ) History of seizure disorder. She carries the diagnosis of a
seizure disorder , although this is , at least recently , poorly
documented. She has been on valproic acid in the past and has been
taking a small dose of valproic acid apparently on her own
throughout this pregnancy. She has been taking 250 mg a week. She
last noted an obvious seizure three years ago. It is not clear
that this was witnessed by anyone else. While in the hospital , she
had an EEG which suggested some slowing in the right parietal
region. There was no clear seizure activity seen on EEG. She
called us to her room on several episodes which she described as
seizures. These seizures were witnessed by several physicians and
were remarkable for absence of a postictal period as well as
abnormal idiosyncratic behaviors during the events. It was our
feeling that these were not true seizures. Indeed , reviewing her
chart , she has had episodes of what have been called pseudoseizures
similar to these in the past. Given her multiple drug allergies ,
including Dilantin , phenobarb and tegretol , we felt limited in our
therapeutic options. We did elect to increase her dose of valproic
acid as this has apparently been effective in the past. She will
continue this as an outpatient. Problem #4 ) Nausea and vomiting.
She complained of persistent nausea and vomiting during the latter
part of her hospitalization and declined to take anything p.o. The
etiology of this nausea and vomiting was unclear , although
apparently associated with some diarrhea. As much as was possible ,
work up for an organic cause of the problem was negative. We
elected initially to treat her with intravenous hydration , however ,
she declined further IV's. In fact , she became quite vocal in her
demand to go home. She understands our concerns as to the risks of
poor p.o. intake and insists she will be able to take in p.o.'s at
home. Given her feelings in this regard , we have elected to
discharge her for a trial of outpatient management. Follow up will
be in the clinic. Should she show evidence of compromise or
dehydration , she will be readmitted. Problem #5 ) Psychosocial.
The patient has been seen several times in the past for behavioral
disorders. It is difficult to sort out what part of her
symptomatology is organic and what , if any , is inorganic. She was
seen by psychiatry during her stay here who felt that she had a
significant conflict in her home life. We have counseled her as
much as possible throughout her stay. She has seen both social
services and psychiatry , however , she is at best reluctant to avail
herself of these services. Our plan at the time of discharge is
for follow up with DSS. As well , we have emphasized our
availability to the patient at all times and tried to be as
supportive as possible in these circumstances.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged for a trial of management
at home. The etiology of her discomfort is somewhat
obscure , however , we have as best as possible ruled out obvious
major organic pathology , including PET , central CNS processes and
fulminant hypertension.
