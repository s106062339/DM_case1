ATTENDING: DALE NED SAVITCH MD
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN ON ADMISSION:
Emmitt Marc Guier , M.D.
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN ON DISCHARGE:
Marco Mccaster , M.D.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Mr. Gramby is a 43-year-old man with morbid obesity , type II
diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , chronic renal
insufficiency , and severe peripheral arterial disease status post
femoral popliteal bypass in September which was complicated by repeated
return of cellulitis x 2 who was admitted with cellulitis and
volume overload.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient has had two wound complications after his femoral
popliteal bypass requiring two separate incisions and drainages
including courses of intravenous nafcillin x 4 weeks and with
vancomycin x 4 weeks. He had been seen by Vascular Surgery five
days prior to admission and had been started on dicloxacillin for
a third episode of cellulitis. He had also presented with fluid
overload and spironolactone was added to his diuretic regimen.
His primary care provider saw him the day prior to admission , and
the patient reported a recent fall and the primary care physician
recommended admission to the hospital. The patient does report
some fever and shaking chills and decreased appetite. Also ,
reported weakness in bilateral lower extremities and right foot
pain. He has chronic loss of sensation in both feet.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Morbid obesity , type II diabetes , chronic renal insufficiency
with a baseline creatinine of 2-2.5 , dyslipidemia , hypertension ,
coronary artery disease , peripheral vascular disease , anemia ,
history of deep vein thrombosis , obstructive sleep apnea , anger
disorder , peptic ulcer disease , and tinea pedis.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Atenolol 100 mg q.d. , spironolactone , torsemide 160 mg b.i.d. ,
Hyzaar 50/12.5 q. day , lisinopril 60 mg q. day , Neurontin 1200 mg
t.i.d. , Norvasc 10 mg q.a.m. and 5 mg q.p.m. , Coumadin 8 mg ,
aspirin , Humalog sliding scale , Percocet , Pletal 100 mg b.i.d. ,
Procrit , Zantac , nitroglycerin p.r.n. , and NPH 80 q.a.m. and
q.p.m.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
On physical exam , the patient was afebrile and had a temperature
of 99 , a heart rate of 70 , blood pressure 200/79 possibly taken
with an undersized cuff , 18 and 99% on room air. He is obese and
comfortable man in bed and in no acute distress. His JVP could
not be assessed from the size of his neck. Heart sounds were
distant. Chest was clear. His abdomen is obese with bowel
sounds , nontender , and nondistended. Extremities: Notable for 3+
edema , and including 1+ extending to the groin. His pulses were
Dopplerable bilaterally with a triphasic wave on the right and
biphasic on the left. The medial aspect of his right leg had a
surgical scar. A healed annular burn wound in the medial knee
and an area of erythema along the scar with warmth , moderate
tenderness , no fluctuance and minimal induration , no discharge.
The diameter of his right leg was greater than his left. His
right heel had an intact ??blough?? and his left heel had a dry
pressure sore. His right big toe was tender to palpation.
LABORATORY STUDIES:
Labs were notable for a creatinine of 3.4 and an INR of 7.1. His
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 75.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
Problem #1. Infectious Disease: The patient was started on
vancomycin IV on admission for his right medial thigh cellulitis
at the site of the femoropopliteal bypass with rapid
defervescence and improvement. No drainage , no fluctuance.
Additional antibiotic coverage was added specifically of
fluoroquinolone for anti-psuedomonal coverage for his diabetic
foot ulcers. The right heel also looked increasingly purulent
during his hospitalization and bilateral foot plain films were
done. These were negative for osteomyelitis but showed a metal
sliver in the right foot and an acute fracture of the first
metatarsal. Surgical debridement was done in the operating room
with drainage of pus , but the metal showed could not be located
even with fluoroscopy. The patient will complete a 14-day course
of levofloxacin and clindamycin for these foot ulcers , and will
be discharged home with visiting nursing care for b.i.d.
wet-to-dry dressing changes. He will follow up with Jerold Cristopher Blazon , M.D. in one to two weeks.
Problem #2. Renal: The patient was volume overloaded on
admission. His torsemide was changed to IV and metolazone was
added and was given 30 minutes prior to his first torsemide dose
of the day. A diuresis of 1.5-2 liters a day was achieved with
this regimen with the exception of a 4 liter diuresis overnight
on the first day of admission. His electrolytes were replaced as
needed. I have expected his creatinine increase to 4.5 by
discharge. He will need close renal follow ups as he may be
approaching need for dialysis. The Renal Service followed him
during this hospitalization and at their recommendation ,
spironolactone will be discontinued upon discharge since his
diuresis will be slowed.
Problem #3. Vascular: Diuresis was essential for resolution of
his cellulitis. Pletal was continued and because of his severe
peripheral arterial disease , he will require excellent wound care
to optimize healing.
Problem #4. Heme: Initially , his Coumadin was held for a
supratherapeutic INR. This was restarted when his INR was 2.2
and he his now in the therapeutic range and will need to be
followed.
Problem #5. Cardiovascular: He was hypertensive on arrival
which was treated with Hydralazine initially and transitioned to
his p.o. home medicines. Even with a large cuff , his blood
pressure continued to run high in the 150s-180s. On hospital day
#9 , Hydralazine p.o. was added with good effect which lowered his
systolic blood pressure to the range of the 120s-130s. Goal is
below 130/80.
Problem #6. Endocrine: The patient was admitted with NPH and
Humalog. The Diabetes Service saw the patient and at their
recommendation NPH doses were increased , and he is now on 90
units in the morning and 85 units at night. The goal for this
patient is below 150 particularly given the need for wound
healing.
Problem #7: GI: The patient was seen by Nutrition and will be
evaluated as an outpatient by Bariatric Surgery pending next
week. This is of utmost importance for this patient with
life-threatening morbid obesity who already has severe
complications of obesity-related conditions. The patient has
obesity , hyperventilation syndrome.
Problem #8. Pulmonary: The patient has obstructive sleep apnea.
A CPAP machine was brought to the patient bedside , but the
patient was unable to tolerate the nose mask. He will use his
own device when he returns home.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
He will go home with visiting nurse care and will need to see his
nephrologist , vascular surgeons , primary care provider , and
Bariatric Surgery following discharge.
