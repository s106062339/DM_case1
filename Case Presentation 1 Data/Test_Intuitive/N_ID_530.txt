HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Aswegan is a 74-year-old woman ,
recently admitted to the Kimonte on 1/14/05 for CHF
exacerbation and UTI ( Gram-negative rods , Klebsiella ) who
presents to the Vide Tutenoke Rahbrier Healthcare with one day of abdominal pain , nausea ,
vomiting , and decreased ostomy output. The patient has a history
of multiple abdominal surgeries including a total colectomy for
ulcerative colitis with colostomy , ventral hernia repairs in
1998 , 2003 , and 2004 , revision of her colostomy in 1996 , 1997 ,
and 2003. As a result , she has had a chronic left lower quadrant
hernia. The patient denies any recent fevers , chills , melena , or
hematochezia from the ostomy. She has stable dyspnea on exertion
after 12 feet , she uses a walker at home. She denies PND. She
has two-pillow orthopnea. She has had stable lower extremity
edema in the past day and no dysuria. She also has a history of
a dilated idiopathic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15 to 20% , MI
20 years ago , diabetes mellitus type 2 , coronary artery disease ,
and chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of
approximately 1.8 to 2. In the emergency room , she was given 2
mg of Dilaudid IV for pain plus another 1 mg IV as well as Zofran
1 mg IV. An NG tube was placed , and hooked to suction , which
drained 1 liter of green fluid that was guaiac negative. CT of
the abdomen and pelvis showed high-grade small-bowel obstruction
with a transition point at the left lower quadrant hernia ,
dilated small-bowel loops , and fat stranding. A second
radiologist per the surgical note said that the transition point
may have actually been distal to the hernia and may have been
located within the pelvis. After surgical evaluation , the
patient was admitted to the floor for conservative medical
management of her small-bowel obstruction.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Vital signs , temperature
96.4 , pulse 84 , blood pressure 132/70 , respiratory rate 14 , and
sat 97% on room air. The patient was pale , ill appearing with an
NG tube in place. Her cardiac exam revealed an S3 gallop. PMI
was displaced and sustained. Heart rate was regular in rate and
rhythm. Lungs were clear to auscultation. Abdomen was distended
and tender , no rebound or guarding. The left lower quadrant
hernia was approximately 15 cm in size and reducible. The ostomy
was without any output. Neurological exam revealed no focal
deficits or facial droops.
OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES: None.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1. GI: The patient presented with a small-bowel obstruction.
The point of transition was thought to be in the pelvis by the
second Radiology opinion , she was kept n.p.o. , NG tube to
suction. SBO resolved on 4/4/05 . Her abdominal exam improved.
Her pain improved. At the time of discharge , her ostomy was
putting out green stool. Lactate levels were followed , with a
peak of 1.4 and then back down to 0.8. The patient was kept on
an IV proton pump inhibitor , then switched to p.o. At the time
of discharge , her diet was being advanced as tolerated. She was
tolerating a mechanical soft diet.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient has CHF with an EF of 15 to 20%.
She was gently hydrated during the small-bowel obstruction. Her
digoxin was continued. Her beta-blocker was switched to
Lopressor. Her diuretics were held. Her hydralazine and Isordil
were held as well as her aspirin in the event that she should go
to the operating room. These were added back. At the time of
discharge , she was on Coreg , hydralazine , Isordil , digoxin , and
aspirin at her home doses. Diuretic can be added back for
diuresis , once the patient is taking improved p.o.'s. The
patient had several runs of V-TAC and frequent PVCs on the
monitor. Her electrolytes were corrected for a potassium of 4
and magnesium of 2. She was asymptomatic with these rhythms.
Her heart rate was in the 90s. Her blood pressure was in the
110s/50s-70s at the time of discharge.
3. Endocrine: The patient was continued on 15 units of NPH
q.a.m. , 7 units of NPH q.p.m. , as well as a Regular Insulin
sliding scale for very strict glucose control. This regimen
resulted in occasional episodes of hypoglycemia to 33 and 44
respectively. The patient was symptomatic with a blood sugar of
33. She received an amp of D50 and her blood sugar improved. Her
regimen was adjusted at the time of discharge , she was on NPH 8
units subcu q.a.m. and a Regular Insulin sliding scale. Her NPH
should be titrated as her oral intake improves. The patient is
on chronic prednisone for rheumatoid arthritis. She was switched
to hydrocortisone 10 mg IV q.8h. She did not require a stressed
dose. She was switched back to her oral dose of prednisone.
4. Renal: The patient's phenol on presentation was 0.25. Her
creatinine was 2.8 , which was elevated from her baseline after
discharge at Ketchwo of 2.4. Her creatinine rose to 3.3 and
then began to trend down. Her creatinine was 2.4 and then 2.3 on
the day of discharge. Her acute on chronic renal failure was
thought to represent dehydration as well as poor forward flow due
to third spacing and decreased intravascular volumes. Her blood
pressures tended to be on the low side when she was first
admitted. These improved with rehydration to the point where her
home blood pressure medications could be restarted.
5. ID: The patient was started on levofloxacin 500 mg IV
q.4-8h. and Flagyl 500 mg IV q.8h. for an elevated white count on
admission of 14.65 with 87.3% neutrophils. Her blood cultures
from 6/12/05 were positive , two out of four bottles in 24 hours
for Gram-positive cocci identified as MRSA. She was started on
vancomycin 1 gm IV q.48h. This will need to be continued for a
total of two weeks , start day 6/20/05 , stop day 8/7/06 .
Levofloxacin and Flagyl were started on 7/11/05 , stop date
4/16/06 . The patient remained afebrile and her bands trended
down from a peak of 39 to 3 the day prior to discharge.
6. Rheumatologic: The patient was continued on steroids for
rheumatoid arthritis and chronic steroid dependence.
7. Neuro: The patient had episodes of disorientation , likely
due to sundowning two days prior to placement. She required 0.5
mg of IV Haldol for extreme agitation. She also required
trazodone 100 mg p.o. q.h.s. for sleep.
8. Physical therapy: The patient was out of bed to chair. She
typically walks with a walker. She will require rehabilitation
for improved coordination and strength.
9. Prophylaxis: The patient was on proton pump inhibitor and
Lovenox during the course of her stay.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Pending.
The remainder of the dictation will be completed at the time of
discharge.
