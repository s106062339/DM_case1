ADDENDUM
Please note this is an addendum to the previously dictated
discharge summary #6047544.
INTERIM HISTORY: In the interim , since the previously dictated
discharge summary , the patient has continued to progress from a
cardiac standpoint.
HOSPITAL COURSE: His hospital course by system from 10/25/05
through the date of discharge is as follows:
1. Ischemia: The patient had continued to remain stable from an
ischemia standpoint. He continues on aspirin and statin. A
beta-blocker has been added back to his regimen and was titrated
to a dose of Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. The patient has not
been started on an ACE inhibitor secondary to his elevated
creatinine at this time. He has had no further episodes of chest
pain.
2. Pump: The patient's congestive heart failure regimen was
titrated. The patient continues on Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. and
hydralazine 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. for after load reduction. He was
restarted on a low-dose beta-blocker at 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. as
well as digoxin at 0.125 mg p.o. q.o.d. The patient was
aggressively diuresed with intravenous Lasix and Zaroxolyn
followed by conversion to oral diuresis with torsemide at the
time of discharge. The patient will be followed by Dr. Rayford Hogenmiller in the Clevesa Irvca Sideenandri as well as by the
CHF Service at Sher-ship Rimark's Medical Center . At the time of
discharge , the patient was felt to be nearing euvolemia with
estimated dry weight of approximately 76 to 77 kg.
3. Rhythm: The patient continued to have atrial flutter with a
block. His heart rate remained in the rate of 100 to 110 at the
time of discharge. He had decreased episodes of more rapid
dysrhythmia following addition of beta-blocker and digoxin to his
medication regimen. He also continues on amiodarone at 200 mg
p.o. q.d. As mentioned , the patient was found to have atrial
clot on transesophageal echocardiogram and thus was started on a
heparin drip and transitioned on Coumadin. However , after a
substantial discussion with the Congestive Heart Failure Service
and the patient's outpatient CHF Care Team , it was felt that the
risks of Coumadin in this patient who has a history of
significant noncompliance were greater than the known risk of
thromboembolic disease in the setting of his known atrial clot
and thus the patient was not continued on Coumadin
anticoagulation. Rather , he was given aspirin and Plavix at full
doses. The use of Coumadin in this patient could be re-evaluated
as an outpatient based on the patient's follow-up as deemed
appropriate by his outpatient providers.
4. Endocrine: The patient remained on stable diabetes mellitus
regimen of Lantus 5 units q.p.m. and standing NovoLog 3 units
q.a.c. as well as the NovoLog sliding scale. The patient's
insulin regimen can be adjusted as an outpatient and possibly
oral diabetes medications restarted.
5. Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from the pulmonary
with good oxygen saturations on room air at rest and with
ambulation.
6. Renal: The patient's creatinine on the day prior to
discharge was 1.6 improved from the peak of greater than 2.
Renal toxic medications were avoided. The patient had not been
restarted on ACE inhibitor , which could be done as an outpatient
as his renal function stabilizes. His electrolytes were
monitored and repleted aggressively.
7. Hematology: As mentioned , the decision was made not to
anticoagulate the patient with outpatient Coumadin. He was
started on aspirin and Plavix. Of note , the patient also had
decreased platelets in the setting of heparin anticoagulation and
thus anti-P4 antibody was sent. This test is pending at the time
of the dictation , but should be followed up by the patient's
outpatient providers as it may input further treatment. In the
meantime , recommend no heparin products. As mentioned , the
decision was made by the CHF Team who will be following the
patient as an outpatient not to continue Coumadin
anticoagulation.
8. Neuro: Of note , on the evening of 5/2/05 , the patient
complained of left-sided blurry vision , which was new for the
patient. He does have chronic right visual changes. In light of
the patient's known peripheral atherosclerotic disease and atrial
clot , the patient was seen by the Stroke Team for a question of
acute stroke. He had MRI at that time , which did show multiple
old infarcts in the right frontal , right occipital , left
occipitoparietal , left posterior frontal areas. There was ,
however , no new stroke seen on the MRI. The left internal
carotid artery was not evaluated , not visualized on the MRI and
there was concern for left carotid artery occlusion versus
stenosis. The patient declined any procedure such as carotid
endarterectomy or carotid stenting for his possible carotid
stenosis and due to this denial no workup with the CTA was done.
It was felt that because the patient would decline any
intervention the risk of contrast in the setting of his acute
renal insufficiency would outweigh the benefits of the study.
The patient declined any intervention for his carotid arteries on
several occasions. A carotid noninvasives were ordered and are
pending at the time of this dictation to evaluate the severity of
disease.
9. Social: The patient's sister , Alexis Fernendez , is his health care
proxy. The patient in her presence has declined coronary artery
bypass grafting and heart transplant evaluation. The patient has
also declined further procedure for his probable carotid artery
stenosis.
10. Disposition: The patient will be discharged to the Com Medical Center for further rehabilitation. He will follow up with Dr.
Kyle Yandle in the T Las on 8/23/05 at 08:30 a.m. as well
as with Dr. Clyde Chatampaya of Elmert Hospital
Cardiology 10/25/05. He also has a follow-up appointment with
TRISTONTERN MEDICAL CENTER PCP , Raymond Banaag , on 8/26/05 at 01:50 p.m. The patient
requires substantial social support at this time , which is being
provided by his sister.
