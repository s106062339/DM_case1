Discharge Date: 4/18/1993
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1 ) CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
2 ) STATUS POST TORSADE ARREST.
3 ) ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: Coronary artery bypass grafting times
three on 5/12/93 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 72 year old man with a
history of myocardial infarction in
1979 and exertional angina times the last several months which was
well controlled on sublingual TNG until he experienced a twelve
hour episode of chest pain which was followed by exercise stress
test on 2/6/93 .  The patient , previous to his recent onset of
chest pain , had been very active with thirty to forty minutes of
exertion daily without chest discomfort. For the past five days
prior to admission , he noted progressive acceleration in his chest
pain symptoms which were occurring with minimal exertion. The
patient's local physician performed an exercise stress test and the
patient developed symptoms at seven minutes of walking with
associated ECG changes. Several hours after the stress test , he
had recurrent chest pain at home and took a total of twelve
sublingual TNG without relief. He presented to the Ings Hospital Emergency Room. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Medications
at home including Tenormin , Allopurinol , and Coated Aspirin.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. Cardiac risk factors were
negative for hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , tobacco , and
diabetes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Cardiology
Service where he appeared to rule in for
myocardial infarction. He was admitted to Dr. Vess
service and underwent cardiac catheterization on 2/25/93 .  This
revealed a 50% distal left main lesion , 100% mid left anterior
descending lesion , 70% mid left circumflex lesion , 70% D1 lesion ,
and 100% right coronary artery lesion. In the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory , the patient had an intraaortic balloon
pump secondary to ongoing chest pain and was referred to Dr. Bersaw
for coronary artery bypass grafting. The patient was taken to the
Operating Room for coronary artery bypass grafting on 5/12/93 .  At
that time , he underwent an uncomplicated coronary artery bypass
grafting times four with grafts including vein grafts to the left
anterior descending , the D1 , OM1 , and proximal descending artery.
Patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively , was
noted to be somewhat hypoxic. His post-operative chest film the
morning of post-operative day number one was notable for
opacification of the left hemithorax. The patient was taken back
to the Operating Room for evacuation of blood from the left chest
and at that time , small bleeding site was found from a sternal wire
on the left side. The patient returned to the Intensive Care Unit
and did well post-operatively being extubated post-operative day
number one. His initial post-operative course was notable for
atrial fibrillation with rates in the 100 range as well as some
intermittent hypotension. The patient was transferred back to the
Ies Hospital on Maryland for further management. On the day of
his transfer , however , while being treated for rapid atrial
fibrillation , he experienced a torsade arrest and a Code Blue was
called. The patient was blindly intubated and from this event , was
felt to have experienced an aspiration pneumonia. Patient was
successfully resuscitated and was extubated several days later at
which point he was transferred back to the Cardiac Surgical
Service. From that time on , he had a stable post-operative course
with intermittent slow atrial fibrillation which was well tolerated
by the patient. He continued to progress well and consideration
was made for need for transfer to a rehabilitation facility but the
patient made good progress with his cardiopulmonary rehabilitation
by the Physical Therapy Service and was safe for discharge to home
on post-operative day number thirteen.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 0.125 mg q.d. ,
Captopril 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Tylenol #3 as needed
for pain , Atrovent two puffs q.i.d. as needed , and Enteric Coated
Aspirin one per day. He will follow-up with his local Cardiologist
in one to two weeks and with Dr. Beauchesne in six weeks.
