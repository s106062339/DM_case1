Discharge Date: 5/30/2003
ADMIT DIAGNOSES: 1. HEART FAILURE.
2. DIABETES MELLITUS.
3. HISTORY OF CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT.
4. ASTHMA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 54 year-old woman
with history of dilated cardiomyopathy
and estimated ejection fraction of 35 to 40% who presented with
lower extremity edema , weakness , fatigue , and syncopal episodes x
2. At baseline the patient states that she is able to walk and
perform her activities of daily living without symptoms of heart
failure. Per patient , about five days prior to admission , she
began to notice increasing lower extremity edema , rapidly spreading
from her calves up to her thighs. She also noted symptoms of
weakness and fatigue. On 9/29/03 the patient reported two syncopal
episodes- the first of which was preceded by dizziness after which
she lost consciousness after lying down. She awoke and walked to
her apartment where she apparently lost consciousness a second time
although she does not remember having any prodromal symptoms prior
to the second episode. The patient was found by her neighbor and
taken to the Niry Hospital .  At Labi Straubll Hospital ,
the patient was treated for heart failure with diuresis with IV
Lasix. An echocardiogram at the Malvfi Hospital showed an ejection
fraction of 10 to 15% , 4+ mitral regurgitation , 3+ tricuspid
regurgitation. The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction and
ECG showed no ischemic changes. The patient did have one run of
11-beat non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Liver function
tests were noted to be elevated. Her hepatitis panel was
reportedly negative. The patient was transferred from Got Center
to Towhiddle Amentcon Pal Medical Center as her primary care physician and
cardiologist are at Oten Memorial Hospital .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypotension. History of cerebrovascular
accident. Type II diabetes mellitus.
Asthma. Dilated cardiomyopathy.
MEDICATIONS: On transfer , Albuterol inhaler , Flovent inhalers ,
Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , folate 1 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Reglan 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. with meals , Colace , iron , Captopril 50 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d. , NPH 35 units q.a.m. and
q.p.m. , Humalog sliding scale , Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d. , and
Albuterol nebulizers p.r.n.
LABORATORY DATA: Creatinine 1.3. WBC normal. TSH was normal at
2.1 , ESR 8. ECG showed sinus rhythm , left atrial
enlargement , left ventricular hypertrophy , no ischemic changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Cardiovascular: The patient has a dilated
cardiomyopathy and was admitted with volume
overload. The patient was diuresed with IV Lasix throughout her
hospital course with successful diuresis of 1 to 2 liters of fluid
per day. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 20 to
25% , severe global hypokinesis , moderate mitral regurgitation , and
moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Right and left heart
catheterization was performed. The right heart catheterization
showed the following: Right atrial pressure was 8 , right
ventricular pressure 35/5 , PA pressure 37/17 , and wedge pressure of
15. The left heart catheterization showed two vessel coronary
artery disease , no obstructive lesions. The patient showed marked
clinical improvement with diuresis with IV Lasix. Prior to
discharge the Lasix was changed from IV to p.o. and the patient was
stable on p.o. regimen of Lasix prior to discharge. The left heart
catheterization , as noted above showed moderate coronary artery
disease. The patient was continued on statin for this reason. The
patient had had two syncopal episodes prior to admission along with
a run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia at the outside
hospital. This raised the concern along with her low ejection
fraction that she could be having arrhythmias causing syncope. On
telemetry during this admission , the patient was noted to have
additional runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia along with
an episode of complete heart block. The electrophysiology service
was consulted and placed an ICD and pacer on 11/25/03 .  This
procedure was well tolerated.
Renal: The patient was noted to have low albumin on admission and
protein in her urine , concerning for nephrotic syndrome. Renal
consult was obtained. The 24-hour urine was collected. Renal
ultrasound was negative for hydrosis or renal vein thrombosis. An
SPEP and UPEP were sent which are pending at the time of this
dictation. The renal consult felt that the diabetes mellitus was
the likely explanation for the protein wasting in the urine. The
patient was continued on an Ace inhibitor.
Infectious disease: The patient was noted to have a localized area
of infection at the area of old IV site on admission. She was
started on p.o. dicloxacillin to treat this infection. Surgery was
consulted and ruled out septic thrombophlebitis.
Hematology: The patient was taken off Coumadin on admission but
was continued on heparin for anticoagulation. The Coumadin was
restarted after the pacer and ICD were placed.
Endocrine: The patient was treated on a regimen of Lentes and
insulin sliding scale. Her blood sugars were stable on this
regimen.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: The patient will planned to
be discharged on the following medications:
Dicloxacillin 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.hs. , Lentes 40
units subcu q.hs. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lasix 80 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d. , and Keflex 25 mg p.o. q.i.d.
FOLLOW-UP: She will follow-up with her primary care physician , Dr.
Avary . She will follow-up with her cardiologist , Dr. Dobies , on
3/3/03 .  She will have a repeat echocardiogram in July to
reassess her ejection fraction and valvular disease.
