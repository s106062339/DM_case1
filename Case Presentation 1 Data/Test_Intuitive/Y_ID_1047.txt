ATTENDING: SARE , EDWARDO M.D.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60-year-old
gentleman with a past medical history significant for
NIDDM and hypertension. He was transferred from an outside hospital after
presenting there with sudden onset of substernal
chest pain radiating to his neck and jaw and associated with
shortness of breath. The patient denied having nausea , vomiting
or diaphoresis. In the ambulance he was given three sprays of
nitroglycerin and his pain improved. In the Emergency
Department , he was noted to have a blood pressure of 200/100 ,
however had no ischemic ST changes on his EKG. His initial
troponin was less than 0.04. He was admitted to that hospital
CCU where he was started on an IV nitroglycerin drip and heparin
drip. The following day , his troponin had risen to 0.3 and he
had small ST elevations in his aVF. He was loaded with Plavix
and started on IV Integrilin and was transferred to In Medical Center for catheterization and further treatment.

PREOPERATIVE LABS: Sodium 137 , potassium 4.3 , chloride 102 ,
bicarbonate 25 , BUN 14 , creatinine 1 , glucose 173 , magnesium 1.8 ,
white blood cell count 10 , hematocrit 41.2 , hemoglobin 14.3 ,
platelets 236. PT 14.5 , INR 1.1 , PTT 32.3. Preoperative
urinalysis was normal. Cardiac catheterization performed on
10/27/07 at Ertrea Health showed stenoses in the
following coronary arteries: 70% proximal circumflex , 90% ostial
ramus , 90% proximal D1 , 90% proximal LAD and 100% ostial RCA.
There was right dominant circulation and the ventriculogram
showed 56% ejection fraction with inferior hypokinesis. EKG on
10/27/07 showed normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 71.
There are Q waves in leads III and aVF and inverted T waves in
leads I , III , aVR , aVL and V1 through V4. Chest x-ray on
10/27/07 shows clear lungs with mild cardiomegaly and a stable
elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for cardiac
catheterization on 10/2/07. He was found to have critical
coronary artery disease and was referred to the Cardiac Surgery
Service. The patient underwent a completion of a preoperative
workup and on 9/5/07 went to the operating room where Dr.
Wink performed a CABG x5. The LIMA was used to bypass the LAD ,
the left radial artery was used to bypass the ramus , and
saphenous vein was used to bypass the OM1 , PDA and LVB1. The
cardiopulmonary bypass time was 145 minutes and the aortic
cross-clamp time was 116 minutes. The patient tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery
Intensive Care Unit in hemodynamically stable condition. On
postoperative day #1 , the patient was extubated. He complained of
right hand weakness and numbness but was otherwise recovering
very well. The Neurology Service was consulted and they suggested
that the right hand symptoms were from surgical manipulation of
the chest or positioning of the arm intraoperatively.
Occupational therapy and physical therapy were consulted to treat
the patient's right hand weakness and numbness. Otherwise , the
patient was progressing very well. He was started on Lopressor
to prevent atrial fibrillation and diltiazem for his radial
artery bypass graft. He was off all hemodynamic drips and was in
a stable rhythm with a stable blood pressure. The patient's diet
was advanced as tolerated and he was producing good urine output.
The patient was followed very closely throughout the
postoperative period by the Diabetes Management Service for high
glucose levels. On postoperative day #2 , the patient's pacer
wires and chest tubes were removed without complication. He was
ambulating and showed good postoperative progress. On
postoperative days 3 and 4 , the patient continued diuresis for
postoperative fluid retention. The patient's white blood cell
count was noted to be 13.7 and a urinalysis and urine culture
were sent. The urine culture grew greater than 100 , 000 colony
forming units of gram-negative rods and he was started on
ciprofloxacin for five-day course for postoperative urinary tract
infection. Otherwise , by postoperative #5 the patient had
progressed extremely well. He was ambulating in the halls. He
had moved his bowels and had no difficulties with urination.
He had no complaints of pain. He had remained in a sinus rhythm
with a stable blood pressure and was oxygenating well on room
air. The patient was ready for discharge home. The Diabetes
Management Service met with the patient to discuss taking insulin
at home for his poor glucose control. He agreed to take Lantus
at night and follow up with his primary care physician for future
management of his diabetes mellitus. On the morning of discharge
home , the patient's vital signs were temperature 97.7 degrees ,
heart rate 86 in the sinus rhythm , blood pressure 110/70 ,
respiratory rate 20 and O2 saturation 95% on room air. The
patient was still 5 kg above his preoperative weight and should
continue Lasix for five more days , once he is discharged home.
LABORATORY DATA: Labs on the day of discharge home. Sodium 136 ,
potassium 4.6 , chloride 102 , bicarbonate 25 , creatinine 1 , BUN
23 , glucose 165 , calcium 8.2 , magnesium 2 , white blood cell count
10.6 , hemoglobin 10.5 , hematocrit 30.3 , platelets 279 , PT 15.2 ,
INR 1.2.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.
DISPOSITION: Discharged home with VNA Services.
DISCHARGE DIET: A low-cholesterol , low-saturated fat , 2100
calorie per day ADA diet.
ACTIVITY: The patient should be walking as tolerated and elevate
his feet with prolonged periods of sitting. The patient should
arrange followup appointments with his cardiologist Dr. Trilt ,
at 320-875-7887 in one to two weeks , with his primary care
physician , Dr. Cordial at 412-768-2098 in two to four weeks and
with his cardiac surgeon , Dr. Maxwell Pullins at 869-541-1864 in four
to six weeks.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Acetaminophen 325 mg take one to two
tablets every four hours as needed for pain , enteric-coated
aspirin 325 mg daily , Pulmicort inhaler two puffs inhaled b.i.d. ,
ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.12 h. , take 9 more doses to complete
a five-day course for postoperative urinary tract infection ,
diltiazem 15 mg p.o. t.i.d. for six weeks for the radial artery
bypass graft , Lasix 60 mg daily x5 more doses for postoperative
fluid retention , glipizide 5 mg p.o. q.a.m. , Motrin 600 mg p.o.
q.6 h. p.r.n. pain , Lantus 44 units subcutaneously q.10 h. p.m. ,
potassium chloride slow release 30 mEq p.o. daily x5 doses to be
taken with Lasix , Toprol-XL 100 mg p.o. daily , oxycodone 5 mg
p.o. q.4 h. p.r.n. pain , Zocor 40 mg p.o. daily , Diovan 320 mg
p.o. daily.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: As indicated , the patient should take Lasix
for five more days for postoperative fluid retention. The
patient should be weighed daily and the physician should be
contacted if the patient's weight , peripheral edema or work of
breathing is measurably increasing. The patient should complete
his course of ciprofloxacin for postoperative UTI. The patient's
vital signs should be monitored by the visiting nurses. In
addition his wound should be monitored for signs or symptoms of
infection. The patient was started on insulin and should follow
up with his primary care physician for future management of his
diabetes mellitus. He should be checking and documenting his
blood glucose levels with his home glucometer.
