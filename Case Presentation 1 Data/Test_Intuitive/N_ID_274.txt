BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Pt underwent a Lt TSR , and biceps tenodesis on 4/30/06 for endstage OA.
Pt tolerated the proecdure well , and had an uncomplicated postoperative
course with exception of pain management issues. Pt was followed by the
POPS with acute pain managed with PCA , IV Ketamine , and adjustment of PO
Methadone dose. Pt was HD , and neurologically stable with no transfusion
requirements during her hospitalization. Standard care with prophylactic
IV abx , and TEDS/P-boots for DVT prophylaxis. Pt mobilized OOB with PT ,
and was seen PROM per Dr Berlin TSR protocol. Refer to the page 3 for
details. Wound was clean and helaing at time of discharge. PCA/Ketamine
was D/C'd on POD 2 , and patient was transitioned to PO analgesics. Pt
stable for transfer to rehab on Alabama
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: DSD qd. The wound may be left OTA when dry. Patient may shower with an
occlusive dressing
Precautions:
7	Sling should be worn continuously for 3-4 weeks
7	While lying supine , a small pillow or towel roll should be placed
behind the elbow to avoid shoulder hyperextension / anterior
capsule stretch / subscapularis stretch. ( When lying supine
patient should be instructed to always be able to visualize
their elbow. This ensures they are not extending their shoulder
past neutral. ) - This should be maintained for 6-8 weeks
post-surgically.
7	Avoid shoulder AROM.
7	No lifting of objects
7	No excessive shoulder motion behind back , especially into
internal rotation ( IR )
7	No excessive stretching or sudden movements ( particularly
external rotation ( ER ) )
7	No supporting of body weight by hand on involved side
7	Keep incision clean and dry ( no soaking for 2 weeks )
7	No driving for 3 weeks
7	Passive forward flexion in supine to tolerance
7	Gentle ER in scapular plane to available PROM ( as documented in
operative note ) - usually around 300
( Attention: DO NOT produce undue stress on the anterior joint
capsule , particularly with shoulder in extension )
7	Passive IR to chest
7	Active distal extremity exercise ( elbow , wrist , hand )
7	Pendulum exercises
Early Phase I: ( out of hospital )
7	Continue above exercises
7	Begin scapula musculature isometrics / sets ( primarily
retraction )
7	Continue active elbow ROM
7	Continue cryotherapy as much as able for pain and inflammation
management
