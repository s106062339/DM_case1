Discharge Date: 7/19/1993
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: ATRIAL FLUTTER.
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES: 1. STATUS POST D/C CARDIOVERSION.
2. STATUS POST MITRAL VALVE REPLACEMENT.
3. HISTORY OF RHEUMATIC HEART DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Dar is a 71 year old woman
with a history of mitral valve replacement , atrial fibrillation ,
diabetes mellitus , who presents with light-headedness x 1 day.
Mrs. Cedars has a history of rheumatic heart disease and is
status post commissurotomy in 1965 and a St. Jude's mitral valve
replacement in 1991. In October 1992 she presented in atrial
fibrillation which was well controlled on Quinidine. The Quinidine
was discontinued the following year in April when the patient had a
syncopal episode. At that time , she ruled out for myocardial
infarction and failed Sotalol with increasing PR and QT intervals.
Holter study was negative at that time. Persantine scan showed no
ST changes noted and a fixed defect was present. The patient was
discharged on Lopressor. On August , 1993 she was admitted with
right ankle pain , right lower extremity swelling. Lineis were
negative at that time. On 10/5/93 she was admitted in atrial
flutter with II:I conduction. Trial of procainamide was complicated
by increasing QT intervals. The Procainimide was therefore
discontinued and the Propafenone was begun. The patient underwent
successful DC cardioversion and was discharged on Propafenone 225
t.i.d. and Lasix 80 q day. Since the morning before admission she
felt light-headed and sweaty. She began to run out of Propafenone
two days before admission and decreased the dose to 150 mg three
times a day. She felt her heart was going slower than normal. This
was worse when standing or walking. However , she had no chest
pain , shortness of breath , loss of consciousness. She had no
diarrhea , no vomiting , her blood sugars have been in the usual
range of 180-200 mg%. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As noted above. The
patient has clean coronary arteries by catheterization October
1991.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is a very pleasant female , appearing
younger than her stated age , in no acute
distress. Her blood pressure is 134/80 without orthostatic change.
Her mouth appears dry but is otherwise unremarkable.
Cardiovascular examination notes a regular rate and rhythm with a
prominent mid-systolic prosthetic valve click. There were
bilateral crackles at the bases. The abdominal and rectal
examinations are normal , stool is guaiac negative. Extremities
showed pigmentation changes in bilateral lower extremities with
well preserved pulses except the dorsalis pedis pulses which are
weak. Neurological examination is unremarkable.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at
78 beats per minute , axis 145 degrees , PR interval
of 132 milliseconds , no significant change from previous EKG from
February 1993.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted , placed on cardiac
monitor and Holter monitor. On the morning
following admission she was clearly in atrial flutter with II:I
conduction block as confirmed by the Holter monitor. Her
prothrombin time was 25.2 , therefore , on the second hospital day ,
she underwent successful DC cardioversion with 52 joules. The
procedure was carried out without complications; afterwards , the
patient was in normal sinus rhythm with first degree AV block and a
PR interval of 300-320 milliseconds. The patient was observed
through the next day , remained in normal sinus rhythm except for
short periods of SVT with sinus pause. She was asymptomatic and was
able to exercise around the hospital floor and up and down the
stairs. Anticoagulation. The patient is maintained on chronic
Coumadin anticoagulation and at the time of admission she was
continued on her outpatient maintenance of 7.5 mg q hs. However ,
over the first hospital day prothrombin time increased from 22.3 on
admission to 28.6. Therefore , her Coumadin was held. The
prothrombin time was 29.1. The prothrombin time on discharge was
32 , INR of 3.3 and the patient was instructed to continue on 5 mg
of Coumadin q hs and to see Dr. Dry in the clinic for PT check in
the next week.
DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS: Propafenone 225 mg p.o t.i.d.; Colace
100 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Colchicine 0.6 mg p.o. q.o.d.
until May , 1993; Lasix 80 mg p.o. q d; Plaquenil 200 mg p.o.
b.i.d.; NPH Insulin 10 mg subcu q a.m.; Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q h.s.;
Lopressor 50 mg p.o. q d; Slo-K 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. CONDITION ON
DISCHARGE: Good. Instructions are given to followup with Dr.
Cliff Norkus in the HAMAC APAR HOSPITAL clinic.
