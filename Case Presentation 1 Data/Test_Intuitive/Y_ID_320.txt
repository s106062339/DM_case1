DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSES: 1 ) HYPERTENSION.
2 ) DIABETES MELLITUS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Wesley Malick is a 56 year old woman
with coronary artery disease , history
of unstable angina , and status post PTCA in September of l990
presenting with crescendo exertional angina. Cardiac risk factors
include positive for hypertension and diabetes , family history , and
elevated cholesterol. Negative for tobacco and negative for
previous myocardial infarction. The patient initially presented in
September of l988 with chest pain. She had an exercise tolerance
test at that time where she went nine minutes with non-diagnostic
changes. In April of l988 , she had an exercise tolerance test
with thallium. She went 7 minutes and 33 seconds stopping because
of shortness of breath with non-diagnostic changes and demonstrated
reperfusion defects. She was treated at that time with Diltiazem
and Enalapril. Patient did well until February of l990 when she
was admitted to the Uscven Medical Center with unstable
angina and electrocardiogram changes. An exercise tolerance test
at that time demonstrated six minute and twenty second duration
with blood pressure response of l46/86 and global greater than 2 mm
ST depressions. The patient went to Catheterization where she had
normal filling pressures. She was noted to have a 30% left
anterior descending lesion , a 90% Dl lesion , and a 40% OMBl lesion.
At that time , her ejection fraction was 43% and she was noted to
have inferior hypokinesis. Patient was treated at that time with a
PTCA. Her Dl was reduced from 90% to 20% without complications.
Patient has done well since that time until about five days prior
to admission when she noted increasing exertional angina while
walking up stairs that was relieved easily with one Nitroglycerin.
This continued to progress , always symptoms occurring with exertion
with several episodes of pain on the day of admission not
associated with shortness of breath , diaphoresis , nausea , vomiting ,
or radiation. Patient said that her longest episode of pain was
approximately twenty minutes. This was because she did not have
her Nitroglycerin with her and was unable to take any medication.
Patient denies any history of rest pain. In addition , the patient
had some suggestion of difficulty sleeping at night requiring more
pillows. However , she denies that this is related to her
breathing. Patient has no history of medical non-compliance and
denies any constitutive symptoms such as fevers , chills , sweats ,
rash , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , or change in bowel habits.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Hypertension. 2 ) Diabetes , adult
onset. 3 ) Elevated cholesterol. 4 ) Carpal-tunnel syndrome. 5 )
Status post total abdominal hysterectomy. 6 ) Colonic polys. 7 )
Gravida XIV , para 9 , AB 5. 8 ) Thyroid tumor resection. CURRENT
MEDICATIONS: 1 ) Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2 ) Isordil l0 mg
p.o. t.i.d. 3 ) Ecotrin one tablet p.o. q.d. 4 ) Lovastatin 20 mg
p.o. q.d. 5 ) Insulin 60 units of NPH and 20 units of CZI every
morning and 20 units of NPH and 6 units of CZI every afternoon. 6 )
Nitroglycerin p.r.n. ALLERGIES: The patient denies any known drug
allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with her husband who
is very supportive and has a close relationship to all of her nine
children.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient was a pleasant
obese white woman in no apparent distress.
Her temperature was 98.6 , blood pressure l52/84 , pulse 70 , and
respirations l6. SKIN: Without lesions. HEENT: Clear oropharynx
without any lymphadenopathy. Pupils equal and reactive to light.
NECK: Demonstrated a well healed thyroid scar , supple without
masses. CHEST: Clear. There was a question of some crackles at
the bases. CARDIOVASCULAR: There was no evident jugular venous
distention , carotids were l+ bilaterally , and Sl/S2 without
murmurs , rubs , or gallops. ABDOMEN: Obese , soft , and non-tender
with normal bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: Without edema. PULSES:
Dorsalis pedis 2+ bilaterally and posterior tibial of l+
bilaterally. NEUROLOGICAL: Non-focal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , electrolytes were within
normal limits. Hematocrit was 40 , white
blood cell count was l3.0 , and platelets were 28l , 000. Chest X-Ray
was within normal limits. ECG demonstrated a sinus rhythm at 90
beats per minute with an axis of 0 , intervals of 0.l6/0.06/0.32 ,
and there were some T wave inversions in I and L with l mm ST
depression that was upsloping in V4 through V6 without significant
change from March , l980.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted to a monitored bed and was
ruled out for myocardial infarction with serial
CK enzymes of l76 , l33 , and ll5. There were no evident changes in
her serial EKG. Of note , however , her second EKG had lead
reversal. Patient did well after admission with no evident chest
pain. There was some concern on admission with the story of
difficulty sleeping at night raising the possibility of some
congestive heart failure. However , throughout the admission , the
patient showed no symptoms of this. Indeed , she slept well
throughout the nights without any difficulty breathing and there
was no evidence of congestive heart failure on her chest X-Ray. The
patient went for cardiac catheterization which demonstrated that
she had , in fact , reoccluded her Dl vessel to 95% stenosis and of
note , she also had her OMBl with a 50% lesion. However , it was
noted on catheterization that there was a small dissection proximal
on the Dl vessel providing a relative contraindication to reattempt
at PTCA. Therefore , this procedure was not attempted. It was felt
that the best approach for this patient would be to improve her
medical management at the present time and then at some future date
if necessary , to bring the patient back to catheterization with the
hope that an attempt at PTCA could be made later. The patient's
Lopressor was increased to 75 mg p.o. t.i.d. and her Isordil was
increased to 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. The patient underwent exercise
tolerance test using the standard Bruce protocol and she went for
six minutes and four seconds stopping because of shortness of
breath denying any chest pain. However , she did have l.5 mm flat
ST depressions in leads II , III , and F and the lateral leads as
well as a l/2 mm ST elevation in aVL.
DISPOSITION: Patient was sent home on her current medical
management with the understanding that she should
report any changes in her symptomatology as well as should maintain
close follow-up with Dr. Maher . She will carry with her , at
all times , Nitroglycerin. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1 ) Ecotrin one
tablet p.o. q.d. 2 ) Insulin 60 units of NPH and 20 units of
Regular q.a.m. and 20 units of NPH and 6 units of Regular q.p.m. 3 )
Lovastatin 20 mg p.o. q.p.m. 4 ) Lopressor 75 mg p.o. t.i.d. 5 )
Isordil 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Good. Her
disposition is to home with follow-up appointments within a week
with Dr. Malecki .
