PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: RECURRENT LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY DEEP
VENOUS THROMBOSES ( DVT'S )
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: 1 ) OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA
2 ) RESTRICTIVE LUNG DISEASE
3 ) HYPERTENSION
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 50 year old Black female with
a significant past medical history for
multiple DVT's , who came in here complaining of increased left
lower extremity swelling and pain. The patient has a long history
of left lower extremity DVT's. She had her first DVT approximately
ten years ago. She has had approximately one to two DVTs per year
thereafter. According to her report , the DVTs have always been in
the left lower extremity. Also , her record shows that she has only
had DVTs in her left lower extremity. The longest duration of symptoms from a
DVT was approximately for one to two years. She has had
multiple other episodes of left lower extremity swelling and pain. The
patient states that she would not always go to the hospital for
treatment , but instead would self treat herself by raising her leg
when immobile. Nonetheless , she has had approximately four DVTs in
the past year. Her last two admissions for DVTs were as follows:
From 3/6 to 5/1/95 she had left popliteal and greater saphenous
DVTs by lower extremity non invasive testing. She was discharged at
that time but did not fill her Coumadin prescription. She was then
readmitted on 3/23/95 and discharged on 1/1/95 with a left common
femoral DVT by lower extremity non invasive testing.
Since the last admission , the patient adamantly states that she was
very compliant to Coumadin therapy. She states that she has had
increased pain and swelling in the left lower extremity. She also
states that she has been relatively active at home ( she does
gardening , cleans the house , goes for walks ). When not active , the
patient states that she elevates her legs. Despite all of this ,
the patient has noted gradual increase of left lower extremity
swelling and pain which has became intolerable on the day of
presentation.
DVT RISK FACTORS: No trauma to the lower extremities , no prior
surgery to the onset of DVT. No known
hypocoagulable state. No oral contraceptives used. No hormone
replacement therapy. No significant immobilization. The patient is
obese , she has had three miscarriages and she smokes. Also of note
the patient had a factor V level , which was normal. No other
studies have been done by patient report or discharge report.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient denies any fevers , chills , sweats ,
nausea or vomiting , diarrhea , bright red blood
per rectum , melena , chest pain , pleuritic chest pain , chest
pressure , cough , or dysuria. However , the patient has had a
significant toothaches bilaterally for the past two weeks. Also , of
particular note , the patient gives a history of sudden onset of
shortness of breath , lasting for approximately 30 minutes or so ,
almost every evening. She states that the shortness of breath is
relieved with oxygen therapy , as she has at home. She never has
pleuritic chest pain or cough with these episodes.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Recurrent DVTs x 10 years; 2 ) obesity and
obstructive sleep apnea; 3 ) restrictive lung
disease; 4 ) hypertension; 5 ) atypical chest pain; 6 ) GERD; 7 )
depression; 8 ) status post herniorrhaphy in September of 1994.
PFTs from September of 1994 show an FVC of 1.85 , which is 56%
predicted. FEV-1 of 1.61 , which is 59% predicted. MVC/FEV-1 ratio
of 107% predicted. DLCO corrected 61%. TLC of 3.32 , which is 64% predicted.
ECHO results from 1994 show an ejection fraction of 55% , with a
normal right ventricular function and size.
The patient is on home 02 , approximately two to three liters by
nasal cannula. Her baseline dyspnea on exertion is approximately
five steps or approximately 1/4 block , but always without chest
pain or substernal chest pressure.
PAST OBSTETRICAL HISTORY: She is G VIII , P V with three mis-
carriages in the first trimester.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Coumadin , 7.5 mg q day; 2 ) Zoloft ,
60 mg q day; 3 ) Lasix , 20 mg q day; 4 )
Axid , 150 mg b.i.d.
TOBACCO: 30 years x one half pack per day; currently smoking.
ALCOHOL: No alcohol use.
IVDU: Cocaine , no use.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY: She has a positive family history for cancer. Her
mother had cancer and died at a young age but she
did not know her mother. Her grandmother had skin cancer. There is
no diabetes mellitus; coronary artery disease , bleeding or clotting
problems or lung problems in her family.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is from Ellno Rd and
was raised by her grandmother. She has four living
children and one child who recently passed away. She has been
depressed after the death of her last child. She is now living
with her son in Barin Ln , I Ville Joseri , Hawaii
PHYSICAL EXAM: The patient is a very obese , black female in no
apparent distress. She was not tachypneic.
Temperature 97.3 , blood pressure 112/74 , pulse 64 , respiratory rate
16. Oxygen saturation of 88% on room air , which increased to 93%
on two liters nasal cannula. Skin was warm and dry. There were no
rashes , bruising or petechiae noted. HEENT - pupils equally round
and reactive to light and accommodation. EOMI. Sclera anicteric.
Neck supple with a full range of motion , no lymphadenopathy , no
JVD; oropharynx moist and pink. Tongue midline with a mottled
pigmentation. Tonsils bilaterally enlarged with a small airway
noted. The left upper two molars were tender to minimal palpation.
The right upper molar was also tender. Lungs clear to auscultation
bilaterally but decreased breath sounds in the bases. Heart -
regular rate and rhythm without any murmurs , rubs or gallops.
Abdomen soft , non tender , obese , positive bowel sounds , negative
organomegaly; vertical midline scar , no CVAT. Rectal examination
was hemenegative. Extremities - there was significant left lower
extremity swelling noted up to the thigh with positive pitting
edema to the calf. There was also tenderness on the left inner
thigh anteriorly. There was also marked tenderness on the left
calf. There was no erythema. The left calf measured 41.5 cm.
There was an impressive homan's sign. The right lower extremity
had minimal swelling noted without tenderness , erythema or warmth.
The right calf measured 36.0 cm. Neuro exam non focal.
LABORATORY DATA: Notable for a Bicarbonate of 34 , hematocrit of
48.2 , and RDW of 17.4 and MCV of 75.4; white
blood cell count of 4.9 with a normal differential. Her PTT was
21.6 , INR of 3.2 , PTT of 45.0. Chest x-ray showed no pulmonary
edema or pneumonia. There was bibasilar atelectasis , which was not
changed from prior x-ray. LIMA showed left common femoral vein
DVT , left popliteal vein DVT and distal left saphenous vein DVT.
VQ scan was read as low probability , which was comparable to her
previous VQ scan in September of 1995 , which was low probability.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was evaluated for recurrent DVT and
possible pulmonary embolus and treated with intravenous
heparin. We had a low clinical suspicion for pulmonary embolus and the VQ scan
was also low probability. The patient was seen by the cardiology service to
evaluate if the patient was a candidate for IVC filter placement.
Cardiology felt that the patient was not at risk for pulmonary
embolus and that her recurrent DVTs were of a more result of non
compliance and/or never completing a full course of anticoagulation
therapy. Thus , the plan was to continue to anticoagulate the
patient and follow her as an outpatient. However , the patient
continued to have tooth pain and was seen by the dental service. On
1/17/95 , she had two molars extracted , one on each side of the
upper dentition. Her dental surgery was uncomplicated. After
surgery , she was continued on Heparin and anticoagulated with
Coumadin. The patient continued to do well. However , the patient's
hospital course was notable for multiple episodes of sudden
shortness of breath , usually occurring during the evening. The
shortness of breath would come on suddenly , sometimes when she was
asleep and sometimes when she was awake. The shortness of breath
would last for approximately 30 minutes or so and would be relieved
with oxygen therapy by nasal cannula. The patient states that this
history of sudden shortness of breath is usual for her and has
occurred for several months. There were no associated symptoms of
fevers , chills , sweats , pleuritic chest pain , chest pressure ,
palpitations or cough. We did not suspect that she was having
multiple PE's. The patient was sent home with an INR of 3.2.
In any case , the patient was slow to respond while in house to
anticoagulation with Warfarin. She required approximately six days
of Warfarin at the following doses - 12.5 , 9/14 7.5 and 10 mg of
Coumadin before obtaining an INR greater than 3.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1 ) Lasix , 20 mg q day; 2 ) Nifedipine XL , 30
mg q day; 3 ) Zoloft , 50 mg q d; 4 ) Axid ,
150 mg b.i.d.; 5 ) Coumadin , 7.5 mg alternating with 10 mg P O q
day.
FOLLOW UP: The patient is scheduled to have a follow up
appointment with Dr. Delbo on 7/25/95 at 9:40 AM. She is to
have VNA service to her home to check her INR level tomorrow. Her
PT/PTT results will be reported to Jae Hobbie , a nurse
practitioner at the Sa More Memorial Hospital BRY CENTER Clinic.
