Discharge Date: 11/10/1996
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Pulmonary edema.
This is a 51 year-old female with fibromyalgia , hypertension and
migraine headaches. She reports two months of dyspnea at night ,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and orthopnea. Over the past two
weeks prior to admission , the episodes have been becoming worse.
On the day of admission , she had an episode of severe substernal
chest pressure associated with shortness of breath after carrying
water bottles from her car. She presented to the Emergency Room
for evaluation. In the Emergency Department , V/Q scan was very low
probability. She had lower extremity noninvasive studies which
were also unremarkable.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Fibromyalgia , hypertension , mild asthma ,
osteoarthritis of the knee , migraines , total
abdominal hysterectomy , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy , chronic
fatigue syndrome , deep venous thrombosis in the right lower
extremity , history of gallstones. Medications on admission
included Nortriptyline , methyldopa , hydrochlorothiazide , Zantac ,
estrogen , Advil , ALternaGEL.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She works as a supervisor to home health aides.
FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for coronary artery disease.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient smokes one and one-half packs per
day for 30 years.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 97.4 , respiratory rate 22 ,
heart rate 100 , blood pressure 150/90.
HEENT: Anicteric. LUNGS: In the Emergency Room were notable for
bibasilar crackles about one-quarter of the way up.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm. II/VI systolic murmur.
No rubs or gallops. ABDOMEN: Benign. RECTAL: Guaiac negative in
the Emergency Department. EXTREMITIES: 1+ pedal edema
bilaterally , right greater than left. NEUROLOGICAL: Nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , hematocrit 41.6 , BUN 13 , creatinine
0.6. Chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary edema.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 91 , no ischemic
changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for rule out
myocardial infarction. She had serial CPKs which
were all negative. At that point , her monitor was then
discontinued. The patient's pulmonary edema was treated with two
doses of intravenous Lasix ( 20 milligrams each ). This resulted in
a moderate diuresis and resolution of her shortness of breath
symptoms. She then underwent an exercise test. This was done with
arm ergometry ( 30 watts ). She went ten minutes , stopped secondary
to arm fatigue. Her heart rate went from 100 to 129 , blood
pressure went from 130 systolic to 172. Electrocardiogram showed
no ischemic changes. She had no chest pain or chest pressure with
this and this was deemed a negative test. She then underwent an
echocardiogram which showed vigorous systolic function of 86% , no
valvular lesions , no wall motion abnormalities. There was evidence
of thickening in her ventricular walls.
Given the fact that the patient had an elevated diastolic pressure
and did show some early evidence of thickening in her ventricular
walls , the decision was then made to begin her on a calcium channel
blocker. Verapamil 240 milligrams p.o. q.d. was initiated and the
patient tolerated this prior to discharge. This was added in
addition to all her usual medications. She was discharged to home
in good condition.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Verapamil SR 240 milligrams p.o. q.d.;
Zantac 300 milligrams q.d.; estrogen 1.25
milligrams q.d.; Advil 800 milligrams p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n.;
hydrochlorothiazide 25 milligrams p.o. q.d.; methyldopa 250
milligrams q.d.; Nortriptyline 125 milligrams p.o. q.h.s.
The patient has scheduled an appointment to see a new primary
physician , Dr. Kenneth Finneran at Dowsna Medical Center .  She
states that appointment is scheduled for April , 1996.
