BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
RFA: Supraventricular tachycardia , hypocalcemia , renal failure
.
CC: bilateral foot pain , sob , palpitations
HPI: 35 F with CKD IV/V ( renal: Nickolls ) 2/2 minimal change dz
was in USOH until 6 days PTA when developed bilateral foot pain
typical of gout flare. 5 days PTA developed SOB and heart racing
which was constant. Attributed sx to prednisone and stopped
prednisone 3 days PTA. Yet SOB and sensation of rapid heart rhythm
continued. She had never had the sensation before and has no h/o
tachyarrhythmia. On DOA , she came to ED for evalulation of her bilateral
gouty foot pain and was found to be tachycardic to 150 bpm. EKG notable
for narrow complex tachycardia ( SVT/likely AVNRT. )
. IN ED: given adenosine 6 mg IV x 1 with conversion to NSR for less
than a minutes , and then reversion back to SVT. She responded to
additional adenosine 12 mg IV x 1 and reverted to SR for the remainder of
her hospital stay.
PMH: CKD IV/V 2/2 minimal change dz with left UE AVF in prep for
likely future HD , gout , sickle cell trait , anemia , HTN , h/o PE s/p
coumadin , morbid obesity
ALLERGIES: PCN , ampicillin->hives. Procardia->h/a .
ADMIT EXAM: Afeb , hr 80 ( post conversion w adenosine ) BP 118/80. 100% 2l
NC. JVP +8cm. lungs clear. +transmitted bruit from LUE AVF heard
throughout precordium. LUE AVF with strong bruit and thrill. abd benign.
Tr le edema at ankles.
.
NOTABLE ADMIT LABS: BUN 80 , Cr 11.0 ( up from 8 ) INR 1.2 WBC 12.7 ( N77 ,
L17 ) , HCT 26.6 ( bl 25-28 ) , plt 244 cardiac: troponin<assay , CK-MB 2.3 ,
CK335. Calcium 6.0 , iCa 0.79 , Mg 1.6. phos 5.4. PTH 914 ( up from 861 in
10/24 )
.
STUDIES: echo: no rv strain. EF 40%. +diastolic dysfxn. LV
d.6.30cm ( mild-mod enlarge ) , mild RAE , LAE , RV enlargement.no pericardial
effusion. Echo is significantly changed from prior 11/21 when
EF was 55-60% and no LVH.
cxr: cardiomegaly
ekg 10/22 QTC=.504
V/Q scan: No perfusion defect. low probability
.
35F with h/o CKD IV/V 2/2 minimal change dz who presents with 6 days of
DOE , heart racing shortly after starting prednisone for bilateral foot
pain 2/2 gout. Found to be in SVT with rate to 150 bpm. Initially ,
high suspicion of PE , given h/o PE , evolution of pleuritic chest pain ,
and SVT. LENI's were negative. She was empirically started on heparin
IV. Yet on HD2 , she had a V/Q scan with NO perfusion defect and heparin
was discontinued. The precipitating event leading to SVT was not
determined. No PE or evidence of ischemic event. However , she had
multiple metabolic derangements , especially hyocalcemia ( Ca 6.0 , iCa
0.79 , Mg. 1.6 ) as well as evidence worsening structural heart disease and
evolving cardiomyopathy. Her SVT resolved after adenosine 12 mg IV x 1
and she remained in SR during the rest of hospital stay. ECHO showed EF
40% , diastolic dysfunction and LVH likely 2/2 longstanding HTN. This
was a change from ECHO in 2002 when she had nl EF 60% , no e/o diastolic
dysfunction and no ventricular enlargement. The cause of her new
cardiomyopathy is possibly HTN and concern raised for high-output state
due increase flow thru AV fistula. We discussed the case briefly with
the vascular surg service. There is no definitive test to determine if
flow throught the aVF is too great. This may need to be discussed between
her primary renal doctors and vascular.
.
HYPOCALCEMIA: VitD level pending , PTH dramatically elevated at 914. Noted
to have elevated QTc of QTC 504 msec in setting hypocalcemia. Calcitriol
was increased and calcium citrate was initiated. Calcium was also
repleted with calcium gluconate boluses and magnesium supplementation.
Ionized calcium was followed. She is being discharged home on Calcium
citrate bid , calcitriol 2mcg qd , and prior dose of ergocalciferol.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You were admitted after experiencing a rapid heart rhythm that normalized
after treatment with medicine. There is no clear explanation for why you
went into this abnormal rhythm , there are a few possibilities. These
include disturbances in your electrolytes , such as very low calcium , as
low as changes in your heart from high blood pressure and fluid
retention. You did not have a clot to your lungs or in your legs. You
were started on calcium supplements ( calcium citrate ) , calcitriol dose
was increased. Metoprolol dose was increased to treat your high blood
pressure.
.
KEY MEDICINE CHANGES:
1. Increase metoprolol dose
2. Increase calcitriol dose
3. Start calcium citrate: takes this medicine BETWEEN meals , as it will
be less effective if taken with meals.
4. It is important that you take all prescribed medicines to keep your
heart healthy and to make sure your electrolytes and calcium stay in
acceptable limits. If you have problems filling your medicines , please
notifiy your primary or renal doctors.
.
Contact a physician or return to the emergency room if you develop
recurrent shortness of breath , chest pain , sensation of rapid heart
rhythm that does not go away after a few minutes or comes on with
breathing problems or chest pain.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Check metabolic panel , including calcium.
2. F/u on vitamin D level ( pending at d/c )
3. Check BP on elevated dose metoprolol ER
