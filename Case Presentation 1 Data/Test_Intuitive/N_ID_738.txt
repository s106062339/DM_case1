Discharge Date: 10/2/1998
DIAGNOSES: 1. MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
2. HERPES ZOSTER.
BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history
of coronary artery disease , who was transferred to
Za Valley Hospital two days following an acute myocardial
infarction , for post myocardial infarction management. The patient
has known coronary artery disease , and is status post myocardial
infarction in 1998. At this time he underwent a two-vessel CABG
with a saphenous vein graft to the RCA and to the LAD. Since then ,
he claims that he has done very well with rare angina
( approximately two times a year ) which responds well to sublingual
nitroglycerin.
He underwent an exercise treadmill test in 1997 , that showed
inferolateral ST depressions with exercise , that were considered
non-diagnostic , secondary to LVH and some resting EKG
abnormalities.
On August , the patient noted 10 out of 10 chest pain while walking
with his family. He took sublingual nitroglycerin times three with
no relief. He was taken to Tioncollgos Memorial Hospital where an EKG
showed ST depressions in leads V2 through V4 , and T wave flattening
in V1 and V5. He also had T wave inversions in V2 through V4. The
patient was treated with intravenous heparin , intravenous
nitroglycerin , and beta blockers. He remained pain free after this
treatment. He eventually developed a Q wave in V1. During his
hospitalization at Frontnor Valley Medical Center , the patient was noted to have
an 11 beat run of V-tach on August , and was started on a lidocaine
drip. The lidocaine drip was stopped on September , and the
intravenous nitroglycerin was weaned. He was placed on nitro paste
on September , and his intravenous heparin was then stopped on January .
The patient was transferred to Hard Hospital on January
because he preferred to receive his care from his primary
cardiologist. He denies having any chest pain since his initial
pain on the seventh. He also denies shortness of breath ,
orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , swelling , nausea ,
vomiting , or diaphoresis. He has been tolerating a regular diet.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Coronary artery disease status post MI
in 1998 , and two-vessel CABG in 1998.
2. Exercise induced atrial fibrillation
noted in 1990 with no recurrence.
3. Prostate carcinoma status post
prostatectomy in 1986.
4. Malaria in 1944.
MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg q.d. , atenolol 25 mg
q.d. , nitro paste started at the outside hospital.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient was recently widowed approximately
two months ago , and has been grieving. He is
close with his daughter. He denies any use of tobacco or alcohol.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: No tobacco , no hypertension , no family
history of significant cardiac disease , and
no known history of hypercholesterolemia.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He was a pleasant elderly man in no acute
distress , who was sitting up in bed. Vital
signs: the patient was afebrile with blood pressure 115/60. Heart
rate was 67. Respiration was 18. Room air saturation was 94%.
HEENT exam showed the patient to be anicteric , with intact
extraocular movements , and moist mucus membranes. The neck was
supple with jugular venous pressure noted , approximately 8
centimeters. The chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally with
no rales or wheezes.
The coronary exam showed regular rate and rhythm , with a 1/6
midsystolic murmur at the left sternal border , and no S3.
The abdominal examination showed a flat abdomen with active bowel
sounds , and a well-healed midline low abdominal scar consistent
with his prior prostatectomy. No masses or hepatosplenomegaly were
noted.
The extremity exam showed no edema , with 2+ femoral and posterior
tibial pulses bilaterally , and 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.
On neurologic exam , the patient was alert and oriented times three
with cranial nerves III through XII intact and symmetric. The
motor examination was 5/5 throughout , with 1+ deep tendon reflexes
and downgoing toes bilaterally.
LABORATORIES AT THE OUTSIDE HOSPITAL: CPK at admission was 2611 ,
with an MB fraction of 260.
Sodium 139 , potassium 4.9 , chloride 100 , CO2 30 , BUN 20 , creatinine
1.0 , glucose 123. The white blood cell count was 8.4 , with a
hematocrit of 40 , and platelets of 160. LDH is 162. AST is 26.
The EKG showed normal sinus rhythm , with normal intervals. The
prior ST depressions had resolved , and there were Q waves in V1 and
V2. The T waves were flattened in V5 and V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Cardiac: the patient remained off of his heparin
drip and on his nitro paste , and had no further
episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath. He underwent an
echocardiogram , which revealed an ejection fraction of 45 to 50% ,
and posterior/lateral hypokinesis in the left ventricle. There
were no valvular abnormalities. Because the patient had no further
episodes of chest pain , he did not undergo further evaluation , and
was discharged home. The plan is for him to undergo another
exercise test in approximately 3 to 4 weeks.
ID: The patient developed a temperature of 101.1 on his first day
of admission. He presented with a Foley catheter in place , which
was removed. A urinalysis and culture were negative. Blood
cultures were drawn and were negative , and a chest x-ray was normal
as well.
On hospital day number three , the patient was noted to have a
non-pruritic , non-painful , erythematous rash on the back of his
lower right buttock and the back of his right leg. The patient
claimed that this rash was completely asymptomatic , and he would
not know about it if no one had pointed it out.
On hospital day number four , it was noted that this rash had filled
up a dermatomal pattern on the back of his right leg , and it was
felt that this most likely represented an acute outbreak of herpes
zoster. The patient was not treated specifically for herpes , given
that he was asymptomatic , and we did not have any proven diagnosis.
However , we were confident enough of this that we felt that it
would explain his low grade temperatures.
Psych: The patient spoke openly about his sadness following the
loss of his wife , two months ago. He was seen by Social Services ,
as well as by the Souzion Hospital , who thought that the patient
was appropriately grieving , and appropriately sad. It was felt
that at the time of discharge , that the patient had proper social
support at home , and was properly responding to the death of his
wife. It was therefore felt that he did not need any acute
psychiatric evaluation.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home , in stable condition
on hospital day four. He will follow-up with his
cardiologist , Dr. Semprini , in approximately 5 days. He will be seen
by the Visiting Nurses Association , approximately two times a week ,
to check both his blood pressure and cardiac status , as well to
help insure that he is not developing a more severe depression.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: The discharge medications include atenolol
25 mg p.o. q. a.m. and 12.5 mg p.o. q.
p.m. , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , lisinopril 2.5 mg
p.o. q. evening , and Pravachol 10 mg p.o. q. h.s.
The patient had been tolerating this regiment of medications at the
time of discharge.
