Discharge Date: 3/8/2005
ATTENDING: MAZZUCA , MARQUIS MD
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Raj is a 65-year-old male
with a history of morbid obesity , bilateral leg swelling ,
palpitations , remote seizure disorder last one in 1981 ,
obstructive sleep apnea , has started CPAP in 4/10/2005 , and
migraines.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: He has a past surgical history of left
meningioma that was diagnosed in 1987 , infection of the plate
that was in his skull that was debrided in 2000 , Achilles repair
in 1975 , and right knee surgery in 1965.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He does not smoke. He rarely drinks alcohol ,
and denied initial drug surgery.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: His initial height was 5 feet
9-1/2 inches. His weight was 318 pounds on admission.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: He came to Miwest Child University Medical Center
for an attempted lap banding on 7/30/2005 .  Unfortunately during
the surgery , there was damage to the thoracic aorta and the
attempted lap banding turned into an exploratory laparotomy ,
median sternotomy , left thoracotomy , and aortic injury repair.
He suffered cardiac arrest on the operating room table. Left
hemothorax and cardiac tamponade secondary to the descending
thoracic aortic laceration which was repaired intraoperatively ,
and his abdomen was left open temporarily with a ??____?? bag and
partial VAC sponge , and he was admitted to the unit on pressors.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Notable for a couple of major events over the
past couple of months , and we will go to those major events. On
7/25/2005 , Mr. Benck was weaned off pressors. On the
10/15/2005 , the mediastinal chest tube was discontinued. On
1/2/2005 , his creatinine started to increase. On 4/15/2005
and 10/12/2005 , the patient was bronched for respiratory distress
with resolution of the respiratory distress. On 10/18/2005 , he
was taken down to the operating room to increase the size of the
endotracheal tube. His abdominal wound dehisced en route , a J
tube was placed , a left triple lumen catheter was placed , and his
exploratory laparotomy wound was able to be closed with wax
sponge to be on top of the wound closure. On 4/30/2005 , he had
a tap of his left chest. There was fluid collection there from
the left thoracotomy. On 8/8/2005 , the left chest tube was
placed and on 1/11/2005 , a left chest tube was discontinued. On
2/7/2005 , he was trached and two chest tubes were placed and a
left VATS was completed again , because of a persisted fluid
collection. On 4/24/2005 , a right PICC was placed and the
triple lumen and his A line were discontinued. On 6/10/2005 , a
TEE was done that showed normal valves with no vegetations and no
major regional wall motion abnormalities. On 9/30/2005 , his
trach was changed to a #7. On 2/10/3005 , his trach was changed
to a #8 Portex. On 11/28/2005 , he had a renal ultrasound for
again a slowly rising creatinine that did not show any evidence
of hydronephrosis. On 3/23/2005 , CVVH was started after Quinton
was placed in the right IJ , on 5/4/2005 , his #8 Portex trach
was replaced with a #8 Shiley. On 10/18/2205 , a clot developed
in the CVVH catheter. On 1/25/2005 , a wound which was being
seen periodically by I&D has had periodic wound I&Ds and VAC
changes. On 6/23/2005 , the right IJ Quinton was discontinued
and a right IJ tunneled hemodialysis catheter was placed. On
2/7/2005 , he had a metabolic heart and began to trach collar
for increasing amounts of time. On 9/20/2005 and 12 ,
there was report that his J tube had been slightly displaced and
then had been pushed in by the ICU team. The patient developed
left lower quadrant pain. He was sent down for the CT of the
abdomen and pelvis , and now the J tube was not fully visualized I
think because it is radiolucent to extravasation of contrast was
not seen and surgery team felt that it was okay to continue tube
feeds safely which we have with no problems. On 6/16/2005 , he
desaturated when he went down for an ultrasound for the left
upper extremity in order to rule out clot because again the left
upper extremity had been swelling , so no studies was completed.
He developed rigor short after with the temperature to 104 , some
mild hypotension and tachycardia. TEE at the bedside show no
dissection or intimal flap blood cultures were drawn. His PICC
was discontinued and the tip was sent for culture , and he
received doses of levofloxacin and vancomycin. He was able to
eventually J-collar through this. On 3/26/2005 , a 3 out of 4
gram negative rods which ended up being enterobacter were
cultured out. We believe that he suffered a transient bacteremia
from the PICC. Levofloxacin was started and ID was consulted
because the enterobacter was resistant about everything except
amikacin and imipenem. On 10/3/2005 , allergy was also consulted
and restarted an imipenem desensitization process which he has
completed , and he is now on imipenem 250 mg every 12 hours for a
total course of 15 days that was started on 10/3/2005 , and a
PICC was replaced. Today , he was planning to go to hemodialysis
in order to exchange the dialysis catheter over wire not that it
is not functioning but because of this transient bacteremia we
would like to give them a new hemodialysis catheter. He has been
able to get hemodialysis with , though some 10 , 000 to 20 , 000 units
of heparin has to be given beforehand in order for the catheters
to flush well , and he will also be going for left upper extremity
either ultrasound or venogram to again rule out a clot in the
left upper extremity due to the increased swelling. His last
temperature here is 98.3 today. His blood pressure runs
systolics 90 to 110 with a heart rate in the 90s to 110s. He is
on no drips or IV fluids , just his full strength Nepro of 55
which is his goal and he is essentially anuric , but when we do
straight caths which we tend to do once every 1-2 days , he puts
out usually 100-200 cc of urine and he has been J-collaring
successfully now for over three or four days saturations in the
95% to 100% and an FiO2 of 40%. OT and PT have also been seeing
him.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Neurologically , his mental status has much improved. He had
initially some ICU delirium after the initial surgery that has
really greatly improved. He right now is on no major mood
stabilizers or antipsychotics. We do give him oxycodone for
pain , which he really has had to use.
Pulmonarywise , we have kept him on J-collar when he does need to
go for a procedure we do send down the vent in case just because
he is still fairly large person and may need the ventilatory
support for positioning. He is right now on Combivent and DuoNeb
nebulizers p.r.n.
Cardiovascularwise , his blood pressure has been stable and so has
his tachycardia. The beta-blocker that he was initially on
Lopressor 12.5 mg t.i.d. was stopped secondary to the imipenem
desensitization the feeling being that if he did has an
anaphylactic reaction , the epinephrine needed unopposed action
and we did not want any beta-blocker on board. We have held and
would continue it starting at a low dose after he completes his
course of imipenem.
Gastrointestinalwise , he is on tube feeds which he tolerates very
well and there are no issues any more with the J-tube position.
We are requesting a bedside speech and swallow official consult ,
though he has been tolerating ice chips and ice cream with
absolutely no problems on p.o. He is also on Pepcid IV for GI
prophylaxis.
Genitourinarywise , he gets hemodialysis every other day. They
have been taking 4-5 liters per day and again with straight
catheterizing once every 1-2 days and usually get about a 100 cc
to 200 cc of urine. Renal has been following him , and they are
unhappy with his course of dialysis. Again , the hemodialysis
catheter is to be wire exchanged today , which is 11/5/2005 , but
again they have been able to use it just fine so far.
Hematologywise , he is on heparin subcutaneous 10 , 000 units t.i.d.
Endocrinewise , we have been checking his fingersticks and he is
right now on Lantus 15 units subcutaneous b.i.d. with a sliding
scale for coverage. He has just been following the fingersticks
that way and imipenem , he is to continue for 14-day course total
of imipenem 250 mg every 12 hours. The first dose was given in
the a.m. on 10/3/2005 , and there are no new culture results
after the gram-negative enterobacter was found. All other
surveillance and urine culture have been negative.
