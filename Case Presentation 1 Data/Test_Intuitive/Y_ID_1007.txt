BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
IDENTIFICATION: 81M with a h/o CAD s/p 2-vessel CABG , redo LIMA to LAD ,
and PCIx4 admitted w/ 2 month h/o increasingly frequent exertional CP.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Stathes reports increasingly frequent exertional CP over the past 2
months that has been occurring about twice daily for the past 2 weeks.
Described as sub-sternal pressure , 5/10 , w/o radiation , and relieved
within 10-15 minutes of rest. Now occurring w/ walking 2-3 blocks at a
normal pace. Also describes near daily CP upon waking up , relieved
within 30 minutes of resting. Has not been taking sl. nitro. CP not
associated w/ SOB , nausea/vomiting , nor diaphoresis. No PND , orthopnea ,
palpitations , nor LE swelling.
For evaluation of these symptoms , he underwent a cardiac MRI , myocardial
perfusion w/ adenosine stress that was abnormal. Cardiac cath. was
recommended , but he sought a 2nd opinion at an MHMC in A On
arrival to this MMH on 10/27 , he was found to be diaphoretic and
orthostatic w/ an SBP as low as 70. He was thought to be volume-depleted
and admitted for further evaluation. No EKG changes were noted and
cardiac enzymes were negativex3. It was recommended to proceed to
cardiac cath. at AAMHC . He chose to come to KNMC ( b/c all of his cardiac
care in the past has been here ) and was transferred on 10/9 for elective
cardiac cath.
No CP , nor SOB at admission.

systolic function ( LVEF~63% )
b. Small region of distal anterior hypokinesis
c. Basal to mid patchy septal subendocardial delayed enhancement
consistent with myocardial fibrosis or scar
d. On first pass perfusion imaging , mid anterior and basal to mid
inferior and inferolateral walls demonstrate moderate degree of segmental
reversibility c/w inducible ischemia in the mid LAD/diagonal and the RCA
territories.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT: 81M with a h/o CAD s/p 3-vessel CABG and PCIx4
admitted w/ 2 month h/o increasingly frequent exertional CP and abnormal
adenosine-MRI. LHC w/ 3VD and successful PCI to SVG to Marg2.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. CARDS ISCHEMIA: Chronic stable angina w/ negative enzymesx3 and no
EKG changes. Recent abnormal cardiac MRI suggests progression of CAD.
6/13/2006 LHC demonstrated the following:
1. Right dominant
2. No significant LM lesions
3. LAD ( proximal ) discrete 1005 lesion after D1 origin. D1 widely
patent including prior stent. LAD ( mid ) w/ a discrete 100% lesion.
4. Cx ( proximal ) with a discrete 100% lesion.
5. RCA ( proximal ) with a discrete 100% lesion.
6. LIMA to LAD patent , but distal LAD occluded ( small vessel disease )
7. SVG to Marg2 ( distal ) w/ a tubular 70% lesion
8. SVG to Right PDA ( ostial ) w/ a discrete 100% lesion.
9. Collateral flow from Marg2 to right PDA.
10. PCI: SVG TO MARG2 TO 0% W/ A 3.5 mm CYPHER POSTDILATED TO 4.0 mm
W/ GOOD RESULT.
Received ASA and lipitor throughout his course. Briefly on integrillin
gtt following catheterization , but discontinued following a
retroperitoneal bleed ( see below ). Had recurrent CP w/ ambulation on 6/16
- isordil was held in the AM , restarted in PM. No EKG changes. Discharged
on isrodil and toprol XL. Should be converted to imdur and uptitrated as
necessary
2. CARDS PUMP: Hypotensive on 10/27 likely 2/2 volume depletion. Was
orthostatic again on 10/5 AM following lasix and flomax. Again on 6/16
developed orthostatic hypotension after sustaining blood loss from
retroperitoneal blood; not symptomatic on 4/30 Encouraged po intake and
held BP medications on 6/16 AM. Recommend that flomax be held
indefinitely; have restarted lasix 40 mg po qdaily at discharge ( should
restart on 6/16 ).
3. CARDS RHYTHM: No active issues. On telemetry.
4. HEME: Cardiac cath. c/b retroperitoneal bleeding w/ Hct nadir to
30.8 on 6/16 AM. Hct stable at discharge.
5. ENDO
a. Home levoxyl 250 micrograms po qdaily. TSH 1.862 and WNL.
b. Held home glyburide. On lantus 10 U sc qhs and RISS while
hospitalized.
6. PPX: PPI and heparin sc tid ( no lovenox in anticipation of cardiac
cath )
7. CODE: FULL
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please take all medications and attend follow-up appointments. Please
seek medical attention again immediately if chest pain returns.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
( 1 ) Please restart lasix 40 mg po qdaily on 5/29 Have your PCP reeval
