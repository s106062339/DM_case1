ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease status post
inferior myocardial infarction.
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Inferior myocardial infarction.
OTHER DIAGNOSES: Rheumatoid arthritis , myocardial infarction ,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , coronary artery disease
status post carotid endarterectomy , status post cerebrovascular
accident , gastroesophageal reflux disease , diabetes mellitus ,
cerebral artery aneurysm , and depression.
The patient is a 77-year-old female with coronary artery disease
who presented to an outside hospital with chest pain that she
thought was GERD but became concerned when it started radiating
down her left arm. At the outside hospital , she was noted to be
febrile with temperature 39.8 and noted on EKG to have ST
elevations in the inferior leads. The patient was med-flighted
to Hasey Health Care for an emergent cath. The patient had 70%
LAD lesion , 50% proximal RCA , and 90% mid RCA lesion that was
stented to 0% , and a 60% PDA lesion , and LVEDP of 33 on initial
cath. Started on Integrilin post cath and transferred to CCU.
The patient did well in the CCU and was transferred out on the
next day. Previous to admission , the patient resided in a
assisted living facility and was fairly active but has had
increasing dyspnea on exertion , decreasing exercise tolerance
over the past six months.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Temperature was 98.8 , heart
rate was in the 70s , BP was 120s/60s , respirations was 22 ,
saturation was 90% on 2 liters nasal cannula. Generally , she is
an obese female in mild distress. Some cough. Her HEENT exam
showed a clear oropharynx. No erythema or injection. Skin had
no rashes or other lesions. Neck was supple with full range of
motion. JVP was approximately 2 with 2+ carotid pulses without
bruits. No thyromegaly or nodules. Chest was noted to have
diffuse wheezing with bilateral bibasilar crackles. Questionable
right-sided consolidation , PMI nondisplaced with a regular rate
and rhythm with S4 , S1 with physiologically split S2. No
significant murmurs or rubs. Abdomen was nondistended and
nontender. Positive bowel sounds. No hepatosplenomegaly. Her
extremities showed no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema. 2+ femoral ,
DP , and PT pulses. Neurologically , she was alert and oriented
with normal mental status and nonfocal exam. Her chest x-ray
showed evidence of pulmonary edema with focal consolidation of
right upper lobe with chest consistent with pneumonia. Her EKG
on admission , was normal sinus rhythm in the 60s with normal axis
and inferior Q waves with T-wave inversions inferiorly and
laterally.
IMPRESSION: This is a 77-year-old female status post IMI with
concurrent COPD exacerbation secondary to probable right upper
lobe pneumonia.
HOSPIATL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient did very well status post
revascularization. She did have some persistent pain while in
the intensive care unit and this went away on transfer to the
floor. She was medically optimized and continued on aspirin and
Plavix , added a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor to the patient's
1B pump. The patient had compensated heart function on
discharge , euvolemic , but she did require intermittent Lasix.
She was discharged on Lasix to treat heart failure. Rhythm-wise ,
the patient remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout the course
of hospitalization.
2. Pulmonary: The patient was treated for COPD exacerbation
with a rapid prednisone taper , and her home nebulizers , and a
10-day course of levofloxacin. Incidentally , the patient also
admitted to having a TB exposure. We placed a TB and that was
nonreactive and had induced sputums that were negative x 3.
3. Renal: The patient had well preserved renal function
normalized at discharge.
4. FEN: The patient was tolerating oral diet well and was
indicated on her instructions that she should have low-calorie ,
low-fat , low-cholesterol diet particularly given her diabetes and
she should watch her sugar and was maintained on her own.
5. Psychiatry: The patient has a history of depression and
noted to be depressed throughout the course of hospitalization
with some suicidal ideations toward the end of her
hospitalization. For that reason , we requested that psychiatry
come and evaluate her. They did so deeming her safe to return to
her facility and adjusting her antidepressants. The patient was
discharged in stable condition.
Procedures included percutaneous coronary intervention with
stenting to her right coronary artery x 2. Please see full
report for details.

p.o. q.d. , Prozac 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Atrovent inhaler two to four puffs q.i.d. p.r.n. , lisinopril 2.5

mcg b.i.d. , Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. , Serevent one puff inhaled
