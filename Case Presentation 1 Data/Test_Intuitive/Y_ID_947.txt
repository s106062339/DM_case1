coronary artery disease with a brother dying at the age of 52 from
a myocardial infarction and another brother who is status post
coronary artery bypass grafting. The patient had a stress
echocardiogram done on September , 2001 , which showed no wall motion
abnormalities , but this was a difficult study due to body habitus.
The patient went for six minutes with minimal ST depressions in the
anterior lateral leads , thought due to fatigue and wrist pain , his
anginal equivalent. Due to the patient's increased symptoms and
family history and history left main disease with total occasional
of his RCA was referred for revascularization with open heart
surgery.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure on the right was 142/90 , on
the left 150/80. HEENT revealed the patient
to be non-icteric. There was no jugular venous distention. There
were no carotid bruits noted. Cardiovascular examination revealed
a regular rate and rhythm with no murmur , rub , or gallop noted.
The lungs were clear to auscultation without any evidence of
wheezes , rhonchi or rales. The abdomen revealed positive bowel
sounds and was soft , non-tender. It was difficult to assess for
any hepatosplenomegaly due to the patient's size. The extremities
revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema. A few varicosities were
noted. The pulses were 2+ throughout. Neurological examination
revealed the patient to be alert and oriented x 3 and the
examination was grossly non-focal.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on May , 2001 and
and was taken to the operating room for coronary
artery bypass grafting x 3 on January , 2001 with RIMA to the OM1 ,
saphenous vein graft to the RCA , and LIMA to the LAD. The total
cardiopulmonary bypass time was 155 minutes. The total cross-clamp
time was 108 minutes. The patient came off the heart lung machine
without any difficulties and on no drips. The patient was
extubated on postoperative day number one , January , 2001. The
patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit for respiratory reasons
and was there for three days. The patient required only diuresis
for improved oxygenation. On postoperative day number three , wires
and chest tubes were removed without any difficulty.
Postoperatively , it was noted on portable x-ray that the patient
had a small right pneumothorax status post chest tube removal.
Subsequent chest x-ray showed a decrease in pneumo size. The
patient had a PA model chest x-ray today that was pending and we
will decide on follow-up depending on the chest x-ray today. The
patient , otherwise , remained in normal sinus rhythm and was able to
be weaned off the O2 with diuresis. The patient was , otherwise ,
doing well with plans for discharge on postoperative day number
five to home in stable condition.

cardiologist , Dr. Labor , in one week. The phone
