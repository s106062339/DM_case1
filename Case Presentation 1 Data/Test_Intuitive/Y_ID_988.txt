was 44.4 , and platelet count was 219.
Patient's troponin I on admission is 27.7. Peak CK during
admission was 977 with MB fraction of 28.5. Cholesterol was 170
with triglycerides being 134. Sodium was 139 , potassium 4.2 ,
chloride 100 , bicarb 24 , BUN 15 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose 283. EKG

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on September , 1997 with a
diagnosis of acute non-Q wave MI. He was started
on IV heparin which was continued for 48 hours and then
discontinued. He was also started on aspirin , beta blocker.
Initially , Lopressor 25 mg q.i.d. which was converted to once a day
atenolol. The patient remained chest pain free throughout his
hospital course and developed no evidence of arrhythmia while on
the cardiac monitor. Since the patient had slightly high blood
pressures with systolics in the 160-170 range , he was started on
lisinopril 10 mg q.day for his hypertension in a diabetic patient.
He also had nitropaste during his hospital stay. He was up in the
chair on day 3 , started ambulating on day 4. He underwent a submax
ETT prior to discharge , went 9 minutes without any chest pain or
EKG changes and was discharged to home on September , 1997. His
diabetes remained under good control while in the hospital. Also
during the hospital stay , the patient had an echocardiogram which
showed the following results: Ejection fraction was 53% with a low
normal systolic function and some posterior basal akinesis with
inferior hypokinesis and lateral hypokinesis. The plan for the
patient will be to follow up with Dr. Theo Sear and to undergo
and full ETT six weeks after his MI. Dr. Sopha will also check
the patient's lipid profile and start him on anticholesterol
medications as indicated.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg q.day ,
