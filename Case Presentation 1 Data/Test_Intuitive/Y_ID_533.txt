****************************************
62 y/o woman w/ MRSA UTI.
1 ) UTI: initially rx w/ bactrim but we d/cd this 2/2 elev Cr ,
electrolye abnormalities and switched to vancomycin on which her
symptoms improved. Thus , we had a PICC line inserted so she cou
ld complete a 14 day course of antibiotics for this complicated
MRSA+ UTI. Blood cxs were drawn to r/o bacteremia given her low grade
temps and were neg to date. We also gave her 3 days of pyridium for sx
relief. The patient will hang her own vancomycin at home.
2 ) Renal insufficiency: baseline 50/2.5; checked urine lytes which
suggested patient was dry and we initiated gentle hydration given
her underlying CHF. This and teh blood we gave her have helped her Cr
return to baseline. Renal US normal. She did have hematuria which may h
ave been 2/2 the foley , though she also had some mild urinary retention
and we are suggesting an outpt cystoscopy.
3 )CV: We were holding her ACE + diuretic until her last day of
admission due to her volume status and Cr elev. we monitored her BP
off of these meds which was stable; We continued her coumadin and her
INR was stable. We restarted her ACE and diuretic( but d/cd her on 2mg
qd of bumex instead of 2 bid which she came in on ).
4 ) DM: we continued her home insulin and her FS were well controlled
on this regimen
5 ) Dispo: w/ PICC line and abx for 10 more days. Pt should follow up
with Dr. Schupbach her PCP.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please take your medications as prescribed and listed on the discharge
papers , including your vancomycin.
Please be sure to contact Dr. Lapinski to set up an appointment.
If you being to re-experience severe burning again with urination or if
