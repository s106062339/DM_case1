ATTENDING: SEIDLER , JERROLD MD
ADDENDUM: This is a continuation addendum to a previously
dictated discharge summary actually dictated on 10/27/06 .  This
dictation will review her hospital course from 10/27/06 through
10/6/06 .
ADMIT DIAGNOSIS:
Abdominal wound dehiscence.
PRIMARY DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Respiratory failure status post tracheostomy , wound dehiscence
with VAC sponge placement.
SECONDARY DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Morbid obesity , obstructive sleep apnea , COPD - on home oxygen
and BiPAP , settings 15/10 , hypercholesterolemia , paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation , coronary artery disease - with echo dated
3/23/05 with EF of 65% and mild AS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 77-year-old female who was transferred originally from
an outside hospital for continued care after a fascial dehiscence
status post subtotal colectomy. She was originally admitted to
the outside hospital on 10/10/05 with abdominal pain. The CT
scan showed free air. She also had acute renal failure with a
creatinine of 1.8. She was taken to the operating room where she
underwent exploratory laparotomy and where she was found to have
a mid descending colonic perforation secondary to diverticulitis.
She underwent a partial left colectomy and end colostomy with
Hartmann's pouch. She was placed on clindamycin and levofloxacin
postoperatively. She was extubated on postoperative day #3. She
had persistent elevated white blood cell count for which they
changed antibiotics to Flagyl and fluconazole. A CT scan
revealed questionable dehiscence of her abdominal wound and a
binder was placed. She was subsequently found to be C. diff
positive. She was reintubated for respiratory distress on
postoperative day #7 along with decreased blood pressures and
increased white blood cell count. She was started on
hydrocortisone and pressors were also started. She was extubated
on postoperative day #13 and was started on p.o. meds
subsequently. She was started on her home BiPAP settings. She
is also started on diltiazem drip for her paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation. She was transferred over to the Vau Haain Medical Center for surgical intervention of her abdominal wound
dehiscence.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Morbid obesity.
2. COPD , on home O2 and BiPAP sittings 15/10.
3. Hypercholesterolemia.
4. Obstructive sleep apnea.
5. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
6. Coronary artery disease - echo dated 3/23/05 with an EF of
65% and mild AS.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Total abdominal hysterectomy with BSO.
2. Exploratory laparotomy with left colectomy and end-colostomy
and Hartmann's pouch.
Please see the previously dictated discharge summary for the
remainder of her course up to date of 10/27/06 .
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:
1. On 4/16/06 , tracheostomy.
2. On 2/18/06 , percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube
insertion.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE FROM 10/27/06 THROUGH 9/10/06:
Neuro: The patient was maintained on oxycodone per NG tube
initially and then per G-tube for analgesia. She also received
Seroquel for agitation and hallucinations. Upon discharge to
rehabilitation , the patient was alert and oriented , moves all
extremities and following commands. She had good pain control on
oxycodone elixir and Seroquel.
Cardiovascular: The patient remained hemodynamically stable
after her initial septic event. She remained in a normal sinus
rhythm for the remainder of her ICU course. She was maintained
on Lopressor 100 per per G-tube q.i.d. Her pressures tolerated
this dose.
Pulmonary: The patient continued on BiPAP failing each trial off
the BiPAP. She would become tachypneic and desaturate with
elevation of her pCO2 once off BiPAP. After several days off
BiPAP trials , the decision was made and discussed with the family
and the patient regarding her need for tracheostomy. It was
explained to her that tidal volumes were low and would drop off
BiPAP and that she would benefit from a tracheostomy placement.
The patient was consented and informed and taken to the operating
room on 4/16/06 where she underwent a tracheostomy. She
tolerated the procedure well. She was quickly weaned to pressure
support ventilation. She was maintained on minimal vent settings
for a couple of days postoperatively. She was eventually trach
collared , as she has been over the last three to four days. The
patient does tire out after two to three hours of trach collar ,
after which we placed her back to pressure support ventilation.
The patient has also had some mild bilateral pleural effusion on
chest x-ray that has not progressed and has been stable
throughout her course. The patient has a history of obstructive
sleep apnea and COPD at baseline. The patient received inhaler
and nebulizers standing and p.r.n. She will need to continue her
trach collar trials most likely having more trach collar trials
at smaller intervals. The patient's current vent settings upon
discharge to rehabilitation are pressure support 5 and 10 , tidal
volumes 350-400 , breathing at a rate of 23 , and saturating 99% on
an FIO2 of 40%.
GI: Patient's abdomen remained stable with a VAC sponge. She
had her VAC sponge changed as needed twice a week with good
granulation tissue forming. There were no signs of infection.
Due to the patient's respiratory failure and need for
tracheostomy , patient also underwent a PEG placement on 2/18/06 .
She tolerated this procedure well. Medications were started on
the day of surgery and her tube feeds were resumed on
postoperative day #1 from her PEG. The patient is currently
receiving Two Cal formula tube feeds at a rate of 45 , which is
her goal rate. She should continue on that. The patient may be
changed to Jevity if she needs more fluid volume. The patient's
abdomen is soft , VAC sponge in place to suction and draining ,
ostomy is functioning well and viable with good output. The
patient should continue on a H2 blocker for a PPI while on the
vent.
GU: The patient is still somewhat fluid overloaded most likely
due to third spacing due to poor nutrition and
hyperprolactinemia. The patient was aggressively diuresed
throughout her stay with the Lasix drip , and albumin and albumin
and Lasix combination. Over the last few days prior to discharge
to rehab , the patient has responded to boluses of Lasix , actually
diuresing quite well and being negative 500 to a liter negative
daily. The patient's weight is actually down from admission.
The patient's urine output is approximately 80 to 100 mL an hour
after a 40 mg bolus of Lasix. The Lasix medication has been held
at this time due to increasing her sodium to 148 on the morning
of discharge. The patient will not be discharged on Lasix.
However , the patient may need a dose of Lasix at 20-40 mg if her
urine output drops off. Upon discharge , the patient has about 1+
edema bilaterally. The patient's electrolytes upon discharge are
sodium 148 , potassium 3.7 , chloride 96 , CO2 , and bicarbonate 40 ,
BUN 33 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 128 , calcium 9.6 , and magnesium
1.7.
Heme: The patient remained stable from a Hematology standpoint.
Her hematocrit upon discharge was 32. The patient has normal
Coags , INR 1 and PTT 27.3. The patient was maintained on
subcutaneous t.i.d. for DVT prophylaxis in addition , to
Pneumoboots. The patient was also started on darbepoetin after
getting iron studies before poor nutrition. There is no signs of
active bleeding.
ID. After patient's sepsis , she remained relatively afebrile
throughout the rest of her stay. She was VRE positive , grew
Enterococcus from her ostomy. She had no new positive cultures
for the rest of her course. She was maintained off antibiotics
for the rest of her course.
Endocrine: The patient was maintained on tight glycemic control.
She is written for insulin sliding scale approximately q.6 h. in
addition , to a standing regular insulin 4 units q.6 h. plus
Lantus 15 units q.h.s. The patient's sugars have still been
moderately elevated from about 130 to the 200's at times. Her
insulin sliding scale should be tightened.
Tube lines and drains: The patient has a trach , PEG , Foley , and
abdominal VAC sponge , and peripheral IVs.
CONSULTATIONS:
Diabetes Medicine , Nutrition.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Diet: The patient should continue on Two Cal tube feeds at a

as possible. She should be trach collared as often as possible
