HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 6/17/2004 .
Because of her diffuse arthropathy and Jehovah's Witness status ,

and underwent off pump CABG x1 with LIMA to LAD. Intraoperative
findings included calcified LAD. She received no blood products
and was taken to the Intensive Care Unit following surgery in
stable condition. She was extubated on postoperative day #1.
She was started on Plavix and aspirin for her off pump CABG and
she needed ongoing diuresis and blood pressure control. She was
followed by Cardiology during the postoperative period as well as
the Diabetes Management Service for blood sugar control. The
patient was slow to ambulate and needed encouragement. She
required intravenous Lasix to return to her preoperative weight.
She was successfully weaned off oxygen on postoperative day #6 ,
she was noted on that same day to have had 10 beats of VT which
was pointed out to Cardiology and her beta-blocker was increased.
She had no further problems with arrhythmia and the remainder of
her postoperative course was uncomplicated.
