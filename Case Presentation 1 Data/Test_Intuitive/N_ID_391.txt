ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You have had a heart attack and because you did not want to have a
cardiac catheterization to fix any blockages that may be in your heart
arteries supplying your heart , we have treated you with medicines. Your
blood pressure was high in the hospital , so we've started you on a
medicine HCTZ , and also an antibiotic , levofloxacin , for a urinary
tract infection which you should take for 4 more days. See Dr.
Garhart in 1-2 wks , and a cardiologist in 2-4 wks. Call if you have
more chest pain , shortness of breath , palpitations.
