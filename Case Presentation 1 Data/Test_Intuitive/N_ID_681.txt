HOSPITAL COURSE:
This is a 41-year-old female with a history of diverticulitis and
questionable inflammatory bowel disease with a known colonic
stricture since 4/5 The patient has had attempted to dilatation
without success. The patient has also recent history
of ribbon like stools and complains of difficulty with bladder
function as well as a sense of urgency to urinate. Her past
medical history is significant for diverticulitis , questionable
inflammatory bowel disease , GERD , depression , chronic pain , and
history of breast cancer. Her surgical history is significant
for sigmoid colectomy in 2003 , right breast lumpectomy , axillary
lymph node dissection in 1998 , as well as multiple Port-a-Cath
placements , and endoscopic treatment. She was admitted on
7/20/04 and taken to the OR for a sigmoid colectomy; the procedure
was complicated by a left ureteral injury for which Urology was
consulted intraoperatively. Urology placed a left ureteral stent
intraoperatively and made recommendations to maintain stent for a
total of six weeks after which time it would be removed on an
outpatient basis ( Dr. Mahaffy will be following this case ). In
addition , they recommended maintaining Foley for five days. The
EBL during the case was 2500 cc necessitating transfusion of 4
units of packed red blood cells. She was extubated and taken to
the PACU in stable condition with an epidural in place on
perioperative antibiotics of clindamycin and with NG tube in
place. On
postoperative day #1 , it was noted that the patient was
increasingly becoming confused and anxious as well as remained
tachycardic despite what was thought to be adequate volume
resuscitation and she was transferred to the unit at this point.
More specifically , in addition to being tachycardic later that
day on postoperative day #1 , she became tachypneic with noted
hypoxemia and mental status changes in need of intubation. Of
note , the patient was saturating at 96% on 100% oxygen via
facemask. It is also notable that the patient in the 24-hour
perioperative window received 14-liter of fluid resuscitation.
The night of postoperative day #1 , as mentioned earlier , the
patient was increasingly agitated before she was transferred to
the unit and although discontinued her NG tube it was thought at
this time that she may have aspirated. She also removed her
supplemental oxygen and was noted to have saturations in the 85%
range with tachycardia in the 140 range. A PE protocol CT was
obtained that was negative for emboli or DVT but was positive for
right upper lobe posterior segment consolidation that was
consistent with an aspiration event. She was subsequently
transferred on the night of postoperative day #1 to the ICU ,
intubated , and had a right IJ central line placed. Overnight ,
between postoperative day #1 and postoperative day #2 , her blood
pressure would drop requiring multiple fluid boluses in addition
to the administration of an additional unit of packed red blood
cells for a hematocrit of 23. She also received albumin. Of
note , the CT also did not reveal any evidence of acute bleed;
however , this was a noncontrast study. She was placed on Versed
and propofol , intubated in the unit with a fentanyl patch ,
remained tachycardic , the origin of which was unclear. It was
thought initially that there was some type of narcotic control
that may be responsible for this tachycardia. However , it was
also speculated that she may be bleeding from an unknown source.
She was intubated , NPO , NG tube in place with IV fluid
resuscitation , Foley in place per Urology as noted above , on subq
heparin with close monitoring of the hematocrit with transfusions
to be given as necessary placed on a triple regimen of
clindamycin , levo , and Flagyl. On postoperative day #3 , the
patient in the unit with hypertension , anemia , tachycardia , the
patient's hematocrit was still 23 and she received 2 additional
units of red blood cells and hematocrit rose to 30 at this time.
She was poorly responsive on postoperative day #3 and it was
thought that she had better be weaned off of Versed which
happened to be replaced with haloperidol. In addition , clonidine
was added to her regimen as well as Lopressor secondary to her
tachycardia. There was close examination of her mental status
during this time. On postoperative day #4 , the patient was still
persistently tachycardic and hypertensive. JP was discontinued
on the day and , in addition , as noted above , Haldol and clonidine
were added to her regimen. She continued to be agitated and
there was a question raised then that there was an unclear
history that was not previously diagnosed of alcoholism and this
may have been an alcohol withdrawal phenomenon. So , her Versed
actually was increased then for a questionable alcohol withdrawal
and she was given multivitamins , thiamine and folate and in
addition for her hypertension Lopressor 5 q.4 was continued. She
was still intubated with goals of weaning off ventilation , NPO ,
NG tube to low suction , the question of TPN was raised , levo and
Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia which would be continued for
10-14 days. By postoperative day #5 , it was clear that this was
a problem of drug or alcohol withdrawal at least that was what
was thought. Her neuro regimen was changing at this time with
various measures using Versed , then using Ativan , and Apresodex
to changing her fentanyl regimen as well as adding morphine to
her regimen p.r.n. all with goals of increasing the general
relaxation. Psych was consulted on postoperative day #5 and
concluded that this woman had a history of polysubstance abuse ,
alcohol and likely opiates , and chronic abdominal pain due to
stricture which probably was related to her opioid abuse; I
believe the delirium was likely multifactorial in etiology ,
postoperative delirium that was notable for significant fluid
shifts , there was the question of aspiration pneumonia in
addition to possible opiate and alcohol withdrawal. They
recommended starting with Zyprexa if the patient was sedated in
the a.m. with a DC a.m. dose of Zyprexa and just use it in the
evening and agreed to taper off the Versed minimizing the use of
opiates as tolerated by the patient and encouraged the family to
reorient the patient to keep her awake during the day. On
postoperative day #6 , her mental status was gradually clearing.
Patient goal was to wean off sedation for a possible extubation.
Her blood pressure as well as heart rate were stabilizing and
tube feeds were also started at this point with multivitamins and
mineral replacement. In addition , urine output continued to be
good. Her hematocrit was stable. Her cultures were at this
point negative , but the antibiotic Flagyl-levo regimen was
continued. Of note , her stoma would gradually start to produce
fluid and her incision during this leg of her course remained
clean , dry , and intact. On postoperative day #6 , she was also
consulted by Addiction Psychiatry who concluded similar results
to recommendations concluded earlier. They would agree with the
Zyprexa and also recommended restarting Ativan , as I said ,
additionally agreeing with the taper off of the Versed with the
use of Ativan only for cases of agitation and additionally
recommended to the discontinue the Celexa and BuSpar the patient
was on until the delirium cleared to avoid a polypharmacy. Of
note , Psyche was able to speak with the husband who confirmed the
patient's longstanding history of alcohol dependence that likely
predated the 10 years that he had known her. It is important to
note that the patient was consuming approximately a quart of
Vodka a day as well as Peppermint Schnapps daily up until her
surgery last April . After that procedure , she continued to
drink presumably about 3 beers a day. However , the husband since
he was working so much was unable to really adequately guage just
how much alcohol she was drinking. In addition , she was noted to
have , this is per the husband , undergone multiple detoxes at
treatment facilities for alcohol dependence and believed that she
had experience withdrawal seizures in the past. On postoperative
day #7 , the patient's mental status was gradually improving with
weaning off of her Versed with IV Ativan and low doses as
tolerated and p.r.n. She , in addition , this day was tolerating
her tube feeds; however , she did pull her NG tube again. Her Foley
was taken out at this time. The ureteral injury believed to be
resolved at this point , continued on her levo and Flagyl with
question of whether or not to stop her antibiotic regimen. On
postoperative day #8 , mental status continued to improve and she
was started on sips which she tolerated well. Her IV was hep
locked and she was seen fit to be transferred to the floor. Of
note , also on postoperative day #8 , the patient had some low
blood pressure which was treated with volume resuscitation in the
form of normal saline boluses that stabilized right after her
transfer to the floor. On postoperative day #9 , it was noted
that the patient had some red stool in the ostomy bag. The
patient was hemodynamically stable this was afternoon of
postoperative day #9. Her labs were checked , CBC , and found to
be within normal limits and her ibuprofen which she was taking
was discontinued. On postoperative day #10 , with mental status
improving greatly , the patient had her central line discontinued.
Over the last couple of days , she had made attempts to walk and
was walking with PT. Her diet over the last couple of days had
been advanced without any problems and she was converted to a
house diet on postoperative day #10. On postoperative day #11 ,
her mental status seemingly completely resolved on regular diet ,
out of bed. It was noted though that she had some erythema of
the mid portion of her wound , three staples were removed from
this portion of the wound and serosanguinous exudate was
expressed , minimal amount of fluid. The wound was explored and
there was found to be no fascial defect. Cultures were taken at
this time and the wound was packed with wet-to-dry dressing with
instructions given to the patient and nursing for wet-to-dry
dressing changes t.i.d. On postoperative day #11 , the patient
was seen fit to be discharged home. Her mental status had
completely resolved. She was afebrile and hemodynamically
stable , tolerating a regular diet , and fully ambulatory. She was
to be discharged home with VNA Services. Medicine Team that had
been seeing her did agree that she needed to contact her
psychiatrist to provide an update of the current admission to
update her on her medical regimen inhouse and she is to schedule
an appointment to follow up with her psychiatrist. The Medicine
Team also recommended continuing her psyche medications she was
taking prior to admission that includes Celexa 4 mg q.d. , BuSpar
10 mg t.i.d. , nortriptyline will be started by her psychiatrist.
Also recommended to continue Ativan taper as followed with 1 mg
t.i.d. today , 1 mg b.i.d. the next day which would have been
5/29 , and then 1 mg q.a.m. on Wednesday 6/26, and then stop
taking the Ativan with instructions of no refills on the Ativan.
The Medicine Team also strongly enforced , reminded her not to
drink while taking the Ativan.
