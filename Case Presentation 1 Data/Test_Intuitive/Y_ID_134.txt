Hospital Course:
+CV: No evidence of acute coronary event ( ekg , enzymes unremarkable ). Due
to med noncompliance ( pt ran out med ) , pt was hypertensive with sbp >
200. Pt's home medications listed above were restarted and blood pressure
normalized to sbp 120-140's.
During hospitalization , CK's trended up ( peak 872 , at discharge 675 ) but
troponin stayed less than assay. Pt has long history of elevated CK's.
Suspect his elevation may be due to lipitor. Pt denied myalgias or chest
pain. Defer to pcp for consideration of switching to other statins that
may not cause elevation of CK. In interim , will pt will not be continued on
lipitor; we have also discharged pt on labetolol 800 mg BID as recommended
by his outpatient cardiologist at his most recent visit.
Pt also had episode of NSVT ( 12 beats ) during hospitalization. Echo
revealed concentric LVH with EF 45% , slightly decreased from prior; but
essentially unchanged from previous echo. EKG without changes as compared
with ekg 4/3 .  Discussed with cardiology service who felt that given EF and
history of LV dysfunction , no indication for pacemaker. Follow up arranged
with patient's cardiologist ( Dr. Rucki ) and pcp ( Dr. Bendit ).
+ID: ?C. diff. Pt reported several days worth of diarrhea daily. Given
h/o C. diff , started treating empirically. Pt was unable to provide stool
sample as he had no episodes of diarrhea during hospitalization. Given
h/o C. diff , will continue flagyl and lactobacillus as outpatient for 11
additional days.
+Renal: ESRD on HD. Pt dialyzed on admission with some improvement in BP.
+Endo: DM. Ct home regimen of lantus qam.
+Psych: Bipolar , agitation. During hospitalization , pt somewhat agitated
and not cooperative. Agitation responded well to trazodone and pt was
able to sleep overnight. Pt resides in group home with access to mental
health resources.
