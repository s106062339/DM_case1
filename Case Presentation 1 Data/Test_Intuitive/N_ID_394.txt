CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath and failure to thrive.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 73-year-old gentleman with
end-stage renal disease , on hemodialysis , with ischemic
cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15% who was treated for C. difficile
colitis and worsening CHF. The patient has a long history of
ESRD secondary to hypertension and diabetes. He began
hemodialysis in January 2005. He also has a long history of
peripheral vascular disease status post right carotid
endarterectomy and bilateral external iliac angioplasty as well
as atrial fibrillation and a history of CVA diagnosed by MRI with
the timing unknown , thought to be secondary to thrombi from his
atrial fibrillation. This gentleman presented with worsening
shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion as well as worsening
dysphagia and anorexia on January , 2005. Apparently , he was in
good health or at least his usual state of health until April ,
2005 , when he was admitted to Aton Norran Rehabilitation Hospital Of for GU
symptoms which are unclear and a loss of appetite. He stayed
there for 30 days and then transferred to a rehabilitation
center. After being discharged there for 1 week , he developed
worsening shortness of breath and was unable to answer the door
when his neighbor knocked. The neighbor brought him into the ED
on January , 2005 , for acute shortness of breath , which the
patient described , has worsened over the past 3 to 4 days. He
has gone from being able to walk across his apartment to now only
being able to take 3 to 4 steps before becoming progressively
short of breath , and he now sleeps on three pillows. In fact , he
currently cannot even get through his HPI without 3- to 5-word
dyspnea. He denies any PND. Concerning for his dysphagia , he
feels like he first lost weight when he was trying to control his
volume status prior to hemodialysis initiation in early January
2005. His goal was to be 114 pounds and he limited his intake in
order to maintain that weight instead of limiting his volume.
About 2 months ago , he began losing his appetite. He states that
this was because of the "his renal diet." It was unclear if the
diet caused this loss of appetite or his loss of appetite was
prior to the diet. Over the past 3 weeks , he has noted
progressive difficulty in swallowing solid foods. He is able to
swallow liquids. Since discharge from rehabilitation a week
prior to admission , he is only able to take liquids. He quotes
he cannot even take noodles and soup. He has no nausea or
vomiting unless attempting to swallow solids and no abdominal
pain. His throat is sore and dry. He constantly wants water and
ice. Also concerning is the report , it is unclear , about a 20-
to 40-pound weight loss over the past 2 to 3 months. In the ED ,
he was afebrile; heart rate 105; blood pressure 136/70;
respirations 18; and 97% on room air. He was given Lopressor for
rate control for his atrial fibrillation. His EKG showed new T
wave inversions in the inferolateral leads and Q waves , which
were new for his baseline in the inferior leads. There was also
an S1 , Q3 , T3 , which was new but absent once his rate was
controlled.
The patient was admitted to the floor and briefly transferred to
the unit for refractory hypertension , though he was found to have
right subclavian stenosis and blood pressure was checked in the
left arm. His blood pressure was fine at 100 to 110 systolic.
He was then transferred back to the floor. An abdominal CT was
done on September , 2005 , which showed marked edematous colonic
wall beginning on the ascending colon all the way through to the
rectum. The differential diagnosis at this time was
pseudomembranous colitis versus ischemic bowel. His lactate
level was normal. He had a benign examination , and because of
the distribution and the past antibiotic use , it was felt that he
most likely had C. difficile , which was found to be culture
positive on August , 2005. He had an echocardiogram , which
revealed an EF of 10% to 15% with global hypokinesis and akinesis
as compared to an echocardiogram done at the outside hospital in
January 2005 with an EF of 30% to 35%. He had severe TR. On July , 2005 , while on hemodialysis , he had an episode of substernal
chest pain. Enzymes were sent and troponin peaked at 18. An EKG
showed ST depressions in V2 through V6 , which resolved with rate
control. He received aspirin and heparin and continued his
Lopressor and statin. The decision was made not to catheterize ,
as he was a poor candidate likely to have three-vessel disease
and not a surgical candidate. The patient made the decision with
the cardiologist , family , and the team. The patient was
scheduled for an EGD and colonscopy to evaluate his dysphagia and
colitis , but this was deferred secondary to the incident of the
non-ST-elevation MI on January , 2005. Subsequently , the patient
was managed medically for his worsening CHF and shortness of
breath with fluid removal at hemodialysis on Tuesdays , Thursdays ,
and Saturdays. The patient began Flagyl p.o. 500 mg t.i.d. on
January , 2005 , which should be continued through August ,
2005 , for a full 14-day course.
IMPRESSION: This is a 73-year-old man with acute worsening
shortness of breath in the setting of a 20-plus-pound weight
loss , increasing dysphagia , and progressive fatigue for the past
2 months. He was found to have Clostridium difficile colitis and
ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 15%. His
course was complicated by non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction
on January , 2005 , with a troponin peak of 18 , which was likely
demand ischemia from tachycardia in the congestive heart failure
setting. His EGD and colonscopy was postponed secondary to the
non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. The patient was managed
medically with fluid removal with hemodialysis for congestive
heart failure. He continues Flagyl p.o. for Clostridium
difficile treatment. He was transferred on July , 2005 , to a
rehabilitation facility.
PROBLEMS BY SYSTEMS:
1. Gastrointestinal: We are treating his C. difficile colitis
with p.o. Flagyl 500 mg t.i.d. from January , 2005 , through
July , 2005. His stool did grow out Staphylococcus aureus ,
but this was likely from colonization from his mouth flora , and
therefore , we are not treating. Per ID consult , we are holding
all other antibiotics and treating only when cultures are
positive. He had a planned EGD and colonscopy , which was
postponed due to the NSTEMI on January , 2005. He should have a
scope done , both upper and lower , 2 to 3 months down the road
once the patient is stable. His LFTs were noted to bump on
July , 2005 , but now are trending down; that is likely
secondary to either shock liver or just his NSTEMI. Continue to
monitor them at rehabilitation. The patient is unable to swallow
solids and is currently on a full liquid diet. After EGD ,
consider barium swallow if nondiagnostic. The patient refuses NG
tube , so encourage p.o. intake. He will take Nepro if asked. He
should have at least 100 cc of Nepro a day.
2. Cardiovascular: CHF with an EF of 10% to 15% with global
hypokinesis compared to January 2005 EF of 30% to 35%. He has
severe MR and TR. He is on Lopressor 12.5 t.i.d. and captopril
12.5 t.i.d. with blood pressure tolerating well. He was started
on digoxin 0.25 three days a week on Sunday , Wednesday , and
Friday , and his current digoxin level is 0.9 on July , 2005.
He was wet on examination routinely and so it was taken off
between 1 to 3 liters at hemodialysis regularly. He had an
NSTEMI on January , 2005 , with troponin peak of 18 , likely demand
ischemia from CHF. Continue aspirin , beta-blocker , and statin.
We discontinued the heparin after 24 hours. A decision was made
not to catheterize , as he is a poor candidate likely to have
three-vessel disease. EKG currently shows Q waves inferiorly
with ST depressions in V3 through V4 and T wave inversions in V3
through V6. The depressions improved with rate control. He does
have a low blood pressure in the right upper extremity , which is
false due to a right subclavian stenosis; always check blood
pressures in the left arm. He has atrial fibrillation and he
used to be on diltiazem for rate control. He was on Lopressor
with good effect. He was restarted on his Coumadin dose at 4 mg
q.h.s. on July , 2005 , for anticoagulation. He is on
telemetry. He should be monitored of his INR for a goal INR of 2
to 3 for his atrial fibrillation and change of Coumadin as
accordingly.
3. Endocrine: Now on half-strength NovoLog sliding scale. He
has had trouble with hyperglycemia for the past several days.
His fingersticks can go up to 250. We think this is okay not to
cover , as when we choose to cover him , he dips down into the 40s.
4. Pulmonary: On admission , he had acute shortness of breath
and tachycardia. An EKG showed S1 , Q3 , T3. PE CT was negative.
There was no parenchymal disease. Some hilar lymph nodes were
noted. His repeated chest x-rays were every other day , which
only showed changes in the CHF status. There was routinely no
consolidation or interstitial disease seen. His last chest x-ray
showed bilateral pulmonary edema and that was on July , 2005.
5. Infectious Disease: We are only doing Flagyl p.o. for C.
difficile treatment. He should continue 500 mg t.i.d. p.o.
through August , 2005 , holding all other antibiotics. We
questioned if he is septic when his temperatures drop to 95 to
96 , but all blood , sputum , and urine cultures have been no growth
to date. You could consider a third generation cephalosporin if
a pneumonia develops.
6. Renal: Hemodialysis on Saturday , Tuesday , and Thursday.
7. Hematology: He has anemia. Panel workup with mixed picture
of iron and chronic anemia. We are repleting his iron with
vitamin C. He received 1 unit on October , 2005 , at
hemodialysis. His current hematocrit is 31. Guaiac stools have
been negative.
8. He has a malignancy workup , which has been negative so far.
He has a normal TSH , PSA , and free PSA. No mass is seen on
abdominal CT or chest CT.
9. Prophylaxis: He is on heparin subcutaneously and Nexium.
10. Disposition: He is going to rehabilitation today on February , 2005.
11. Code status: DNR/DNI.
12. Health care proxy: His brother , Son Gonzaliz ,
167-227-0450.
PLAN TO DO:
1. Hemodialysis on Tuesdays , Thursdays , and Saturdays.
2. Continue Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. from January , 2005 , to
August , 2005.
3. Follow INR for goal of 2 to 3 for atrial fibrillation , on
Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q.h.s. currently.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n.
headache; aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.; captopril 12.5 mg p.o.
t.i.d.; Peridex Mouthwash 0.12% b.i.d.; digoxin 0.125 mg p.o.
every Sunday , Wednesday , and Friday; Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o.
t.i.d.; Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d.; nystatin swish and swallow;
Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q.p.m.; Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s.; and Nexium 20
mg p.o. q.d. NovoLog sliding scale: If blood sugars are less
than 125 , give 0. Actually , give 0 until blood sugars are 251 to
300 , then give 2 units; 301 to 350 , give 4; and 351 to 400 , give
6. Also , ??___??.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: The patient was discharged , condition
stable.
