Discharge Date: 4/22/2003
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 67-year-old man with a
history of coronary artery disease
status post coronary artery bypass grafting , mitral valve
replacement with previous history of endocarditis in April 2002
who presents with severe back pain. The patient was well until
Friday before admission when he drove 2 1/2 hours to Coln As Las
and he had some back stiffness. The following day the patient
noted back pain , took some Tylenol but remained "stiff all day".
On the following day , Sunday , he appeared better , able to tolerate
walking well. On Monday he again had severe pain , came to the
emergency department here at Ux Erla A Hospital where he
had a CT of the spine and chest without evidence of abnormalities.
He was discharged to home with Percocet. On the morning of
admission the patient was again with pain. He was urged by his
cardiologist to come to the emergency department to rule out
epidural abscess , work up for cause of back pain. He was negative
for any fever or chills. No bowel or bladder incontinence. No
radiation of pain down the legs.

mg q day , Imdur 30 mg q day , Captopril
50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Toprol 50 mg q day , Lipitor 80 mg q day ,
Coumadin 3 mg po q day , Levoxine 75 mg q day , Lasix p.r.n.

of 11.17 , hematocrit of 44.6 ,
platelet count of 129 , with 27 lymphocytes , 55 neutrophils , D-dimer
278.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 67-year-old male with a history of mitral valve
replacement complaining of severe back pain with
Streptococcus endocarditis in 2002 admitted of thoracic back pain
for four days. The pain progressed to the point where the patient
had difficulty ambulating secondary to the pain. CT scan of the
thoracic and lumbar spine on May , 2003 were negative for
abscess. The patient had no fevers. His admission exam was benign
with no aortic insufficiency and normal neurological exam. There
was variable pain to palpation over the ribs with no pain to
palpation over the spine. The patient was managed conservatively
with Oxycodone , Motrin and Baclofen. He was initially admitted to
GMS , and troponin was initially positive at 0.12 and then became
negative.
1. Infectious disease: Blood cultures drawn on March , 2003
grew 2/2 bottles of gram positive cocci in clusters and pairs. Due
to concern for prosthetic valve endocarditis or potential epidural
abscess , the patient was transferred to cardiology. Infectious
disease consult was obtained. Vancomycin and gentamicin were
started on March , 2003. On October , 2003 a transesophageal
echocardiogram was negative for vegetation. A MRI of the spine was
negative for osteomyelitis , epidural abscess however the MRI did
show severe degenerative joint disease possibly causing the
patient's back pain. The patient has had numerous positive blood
cultures for Streptococcus sanguous ( Viridans group ) , blood
cultures were last positive on March , 2003 with a negative work
up including a negative transthoracic echocardiogram and negative
transesophageal echocardiogram , negative chest CT x 2 , negative
abdominal CT ( which did show a small liver cyst ) , negative tagged
white blood cell count scan and a negative back MRI. Dental
consult saw no abscesses thus no evidence of a large septic source
from the mouth although this particular bacteria raises suspicion
for an oral source. Repeat films and dental evaluation on November , 2003 required the patient to get teeth cleaning as an
outpatient. There is a question of some seeding from bleeding gums
that occur about once weekly while the patient is brushing from
poor dentition and gum care. The dentist recommended deep cleaning
as an outpatient with prophylactic antibiotics. the patient was
initially started on gentamicin , vancomycin , on October , 2003
switched to gentamicin and penicillin. He will complete a 2 week
course of gentamicin and penicillin G on November , 2003. At that time
on August , 2003 the patient should start a 4-week course of
ceftriaxone 1 gram q day. PICC line was placed on August , 2003
to provide long term access for antibiotics.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient was continued on Toprol , Imdur ,
switched from Captopril to Lisinopril. Rhythm: The patient was on
amniocentesis , digoxin , Coumadin for St. Jude valve and paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation. CT and MRI is negative. Pain significantly
improved on January , 2003. The patient was on Neurontin and
OxyContin and oxycodone and Motrin , may benefit from restarting on
Baclofen if pain not well controlled on this regimen or persists
outside the treatment of endocarditis.
3. Endocrine: Continue on Synthroid.
DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE: Insurance does not cover home
antibiotics so the patient will be
discharged to a skilled nursing facility for intravenous
antibiotics likely to the O Hospital on August ,
2003.
TO DO PLAN:
1. Follow the patient's INR closely while on Motrin and
antibiotics , in the past when on antibiotics his INR has been
difficult to control , goal range for the patient should be
around 2.8 to 3.5 and his Coumadin was increased from 3-4 mg
on August , 2003 given that his INR was trending downward to
2.0 on January , 2003.
2. Complete a 14-day course of penicillin G , gentamicin on November ,
2003 then complete additional four seeks of ceftriaxone
starting on August , 2003 to be completed on July , 2003.
3. The pain is likely secondary at least partially to
degenerative joint disease with some contribution possibly
from an infectious source but unlikely. Should titrate the
pain medications down as tolerated.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q day , digoxin
0.125 mg p.o. q day , Colace 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Motrin 400-600 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n. for back or
musculoskeletal pain take with food , Synthroid 75 mcg p.o. q day ,
oxycodone 5-10 mg p.o. q 4-6h p.r.n. pain hold if somnolent or
respiratory rate less than 12 , Senna tablets two tablets p.o.
b.i.d. , Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q day , Toprol XL 50 mg p.o. q day , Imdur
30 mg p.o. q day , Lipitor 80 mg p.o. q day , Prilosec 40 mg p.o. q
day , Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q day , Neurontin 300 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
gentamicin sulfate 110 mg IV q 12h x six days , penicillin G 3
million units IV q 4h x six days , Ceftriaxone not to be started
until August , 2003 for 28 day course ending July , 2003 1000 mg
intravenously q day , OxyContin 30 mg p.o. q 12h x seven days.
FOLLOW UP: The patient should follow up with Dr. Jefferey Mero ,
cardiologist at Blackci Medical Center who knows
the patient well and who also will follow his INR levels once
discharged from the rehabilitation center.
