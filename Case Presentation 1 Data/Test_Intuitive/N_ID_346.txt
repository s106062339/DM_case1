HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 63 year old woman
with ischemic cardiomyopathy who now
presents with fever , malaise , and rigors. In April of 1991 the
patient suffered an anterolateral myocardial infarction and was
treated with TPA. She had recurrent chest pain five days later and
was retreated with TPA without improvement and then underwent PTCA
of her left anterior descending artery. The left ventriculogram at
that time revealed an ejection fraction of 20%. This myocardial
infarction was complicated by pericardial tamponade and hypotension
treated with pericardiocentesis. She also subsequent to this had
suffered recurrent episodes of congestive heart failure and
ventricular tachycardia. An echocardiogram at this time revealed a
significantly decreased ejection fraction with a new left
ventricular aneurysm and moderate mitral regurgitation. She was
evaluated for cardiac transplant but opted for Amiodarone and
aneurysmectomy/AICD implantation. In February of 1991 a cardiac
catheterization revealed an ejection fraction of 18%. The patient
was seen in cardiomyopathy clinic on 1/18/95 and complained of
chills and weakness and subsequent urinalysis was consistent with
urinary tract infection. She was started on Bactrim p.o. Since
then she has had increased nausea and vomiting with three episodes
of falling and imbalance. She denies dizziness , lightheadedness ,
palpitations , or chest pain. She denies fever or chills although
she had rigors in the emergency room.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Ischemic cardiomyopathy. Hypertension.
Increased cholesterol. Diabetes mellitus.
Coronary artery disease status post anterior myocardial infarction
complicated by ventricular tachycardia and congestive heart
failure. Left ventricular aneurysmectomy. AICD placement. Status
post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy. Status post cholecystectomy and
appendectomy.
MEDICATIONS: Coumadin , Cardene , Digoxin , Synthroid , Zocor ,
Captopril , Lasix , K-Dur , vitamin C , insulin , and
magnesium.
FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for brother who suffered a myocardial
infarction at the age of 50. She does not smoke
and does not drink alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is a well appearing woman in no apparent
distress. Temperature 101.2 , pulse 77 ,
blood pressure 102/52 , oxygen saturation 91% on room air. The
examination was notable for lungs that had faint bibasilar rales.
The heart examination showed a regular rate and rhythm with S1 and
S2 and 2 out of 6 systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border
radiating to the left lower sternal border. Abdomen: Soft and
nontender. No hepatosplenomegaly. Back: No costovertebral angle
tenderness. Rectal: Guaiac negative. Extremities: No clubbing ,
cyanosis , or edema.
LABORATORY DATA: Admission laboratory data was unremarkable.
Chest x-ray showed no congestive heart failure
and no infiltrates. The ECG was unchanged compared with previous
ECGs. The urinalysis was notable for too numerous to count WBCs.
The urine culture showed Escherichia coli.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and started on IV
antibiotics , specifically Ampicillin and
Gentamycin. She was gently hydrated. Over the next several days
she continued to improve although she still felt moderately weak.
Her urine cultures grew an organism which was sensitive to
Ampicillin and she was discharged on p.o. Ampicillin to follow-up
with her primary cardiologist , Dr. Clement Wittig , to document
resolution of her symptoms and to return to normal state of health.
