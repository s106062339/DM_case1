BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
cc: CP
*****************************
HPI: 75M w/ hx of DM , HTN , Hchol , recent CVA ( 4/06 ) , Afib ,
CRI , CAD/MI s/p RCA stenting ( 2002 ) and poor cardiac f/up ( Dr.
Sarcinella ) p/w CP. States feeling ok when awoke this AM. Then had
fleeting substernal cp ( 30sec ) w/out SOB , N/V/Radiation , not like
prior CP. Shortly after had another fleeting episode.
Concerned came to ED where was pain free. Given ASA X 1. Enzymes neg
X1 , EKG w/ bs line abnormality but unchanged. Per outpt cardiologist ,
preffered admission to WESWA MEMORIAL MEDICAL CENTER team for R/O.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. )
CARDS: Admitted for R/O. While presentation not suspicious
for current cardiac event , given history of cardiac dz , mulitple risk
factors and atypical presentations assoc w/ dm , reasonable to R/O. Note ,
Pt did have recent negative stress test at CJCGH , though limited study.
In house , continued on ASA , BB , STATIN , ACE. His lipids were mildly
elevated with LDL 80s , though already on Lipitor 80 and cholestyramine.
HGA1c was pending at time of discharge but should be followed as
outpatient to ensure good DM control. Of note , Pt had HR to the 40's
inhouse , though asymptomatic. He was maintained on lopressor while
observed and transitioned to his home dose of Atenolol 50qd which has
been a stable , asymptomatic dose. Given extremely low risk presentation
and r/o , pt was discharged following morning for outpatient follow up. If
a repeat imaging is performed , may reccomend for chemical stress study as
prior stress limited. Should note that EKG had evidence of significant
LVH and repol abnormality corroberated with recent echo. Would continue
to assess for possible hypertrophic cardiomyopathy along with familial
risk assessment as outpatient.
Patient also w/ hx of Parox Afib , now in sinus and recent stroke. His
rate was well cotnrolled in house on BB. On admission , INR was 3.2 and
warfarin dose reduced to 2mg ( from 4mg ). On following day , INR 3.4. Pt
instructed to hold dose that evening and will follow in coumadin clinic
on 2/22/06 .
