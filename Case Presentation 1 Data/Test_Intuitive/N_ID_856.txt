Discharge Date: 1/18/2006
ATTENDING: MONTESINOS , DANA M.D.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 90+-year-old man with
multiple medical problems , who was recently admitted for a delta
MS and found to have multiple posterior circulation infarcts ,
likely embolic in nature. He was discharged yesterday and now
presents with fevers , chills , shaking , and increasing abdominal
distention. On admission also , noted to have increased sputum
production and therefore question aspiration event was considered
while at rehab. At his recent hospital stay , he was evaluated
for PFO , which was found to be negative , had no paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation , had hypertensive episodes to systolic blood
pressure of 240 , which responded well to hydralazine. Had a
troponin leak to peak of 1.94 , which trended down and was
considered to be demand related. At baseline , the patient lives
with his wife at home , walks with a walker , and requires
assistance with ADLs. On arrival on the floor , the patient had a
temperature of 101.3 , axillary , heart rate 80s to 90s , blood
pressure 180s/80s , and O2 saturation of 97% on three liters. His
abdomen was found to be quite distended , however not rigid and
had no peritoneal signs.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Right hip fracture status post right hemiarthroplasty.
2. Non insulin-dependent diabetes.
3. Depression.
4. Psoriasis.
5. Leiomyoma.
6. Hypertension.
7. SVT.
8. History of GI bleed.
9. Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 1.3
to 1.6.
10. Embolic stroke in October of 2006.
IMPORTANT STUDIES:
1. Chest PA and lateral dated 1/10/06 , increased opacification
seen on the lateral view over the lung base concerning for
pneumonia , which is probably in the left lower lobe , atelectasis
was seen in the right lung , tiny bilateral pleural effusions are
possible , and heart size is normal.
2. Abdominal ultrasound on 3/1/06 : 1 ) Contracted gallbladder
with gallstones. No sonographic evidence for acute
cholecystitis. 2 ) Bilateral pleural effusions.
3. KUB dated 4/5/06 , no subdiaphragmatic air is seen , no
high-grade obstruction , and limited study due to motion artifact.
4. Urine culture on 4/5/06 , greater than 100 , 000 pansensitive
E. coli.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. The patient was found to have a pansensitive E. coli UTI and a
questionable left lower lobe pneumonia , which would have likely
been due to aspiration given the patient's recent stroke and
documented aspiration by Speech and Swallow on previous
admission. The patient's white count , which was initially 19.8
on the day of admission trended down over the first three days of
his admission as he was treated with Levaquin. The Levaquin ,
which will cover both the urinary tract infection and the
possibility of aspiration pneumonia will be continued for a total
of a 14-day course to end on 11/16/06. The patient's blood
cultures showed no growth.
2. GU , the patient was found to have 1.5 mL of urine in his
bladder when he was admitted indicating significant urinary
retention. A Foley was placed and the patient drained the urine.
The patient was started on Flomax to improve his recovery from
the urethral obstruction. Most likely , the patient has
underlying urinary retention that was exacerbated by his recent
Foley placement during his previous admission. Then when he went
to rehab without the Foley ( note he did void several times prior
to discharge from the hospital ). The patient developed urinary
obstruction likely contributing to his urinary tract infection
and requiring readmission. The Foley was kept in place until
hospital day four. When the Foley was taken out , the patient did
not void at all. A bladder scan ten hours after the Foley was
taken out revealed 432 mL of urine in his bladder. A Foley was
replaced in his bladder and Urology was consulted. Urology
recommended bladder rest for seven days meaning that the Foley
should be left in place for seven days and then he is to follow
up with Dr. Booker Randgaard with the Foley still in place for a
voiding trial within a week after discharge.
3. Renal , the patient's creatinine at admission was 2.2 , which
is significantly above his baseline. This was attributed to
acute renal failure secondary to the urinary obstruction. When
the Foley was placed , his creatinine steadily declined , and on
the day prior to discharge was 1.2 , which is within his normal
range.
4. Cardiovascular , the patient continued to be hypertensive with
SBPs greater than 200 , particularly at night. Therefore , during
his hospital course , his blood pressure regimen was titrated up
such that at the time of discharge , his blood pressure regimen is
Lopressor 50 q.i.d. and Norvasc 10 daily. Blood pressures during
24 hours prior to discharge ranged from 110 to 140/70s and his
heart rate ranged 64 to 82.
5. Endocrine , the patient was treated with insulin and his p.o.
regimen while inhouse and this can be continued at rehab. He
will be discharged on Lantus 12 , NovoLog sliding scale , and
tolbutamide 500 daily.
6. GI , the patient had a steadily rising alk phos through the
course of his hospital stay. At admission , it was 206 and it
rose to 508. A GGT was drawn and found to also be elevated at
119 , therefore a right upper quadrant ultrasound was completed ,
which showed a contracted gallbladder with gallstones but no
acute cholecystitis. The patient was found to be constipated on
the day prior to discharge and was given a Dulcolax suppository ,
which had worked in the past.
7. Prophylaxis , the patient received Lovenox subcu daily.
CODE STATUS: The patient is DNI though he would want to be
resuscitated with CPR , defibrillated , and given pressors.
CONTACT INFORMATION: His son , Dr. Olen Stroebel , can be contacted
at 471-446-0880 or 167-100-0595. His wife can be contacted at
081-581-0406.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Urinary retention leading to urinary tract
infection , possible aspiration pneumonia.
