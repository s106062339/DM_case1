Discharge Date: 4/10/1991
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: CHIEF COMPLAINT is coronary artery
disease. The patient is a 48 year old
male with new-onset angina and a positive exercise tolerance test ,
admitted at this time for elective cardiac catheterization. The
patient first noted chest tightness while walking in the cold 4
months ago. He subsequently had a positive exercise tolerance test
at a very short period of time. The thallium test showed
reperfusion in the anteroseptal and apex areas. The cardiac
catheterization this admission showed 50% proximal circumflex , 70%
obtuse marginal branch #2 , mid right coronary artery subtotal
occlusion , and 80% left anterior descending. He had hypokinetic
left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 55%.
ALLERGIES are no known drug allergies. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
reveals hypertension and adult-onset diabetes with
hypercholesterolism. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE were Diabeta 10
milligrams by mouth each morning , Vasotec 5 milligrams by mouth per
day , atenolol 50 milligrams by mouth twice a day , iron sulfate ,
allopurinol , Colace , aspirin and ciprofloxacin 500 twice a day
times 5 days. The patient is a former smoker.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was an obese male , with
examination otherwise unremarkable , no
cardiac abnormalities , lungs were clear.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Electrolytes were normal preoperatively ,
except for sugar in the middle 150's
range.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to surgery on 15 of November ,
where he underwent a coronary artery bypass
grafting times 3 with left internal mammary artery to the left
anterior descending , left saphenous vein graft to the marginal and
to the posterior descending artery. The patient tolerated the
procedure well. The posterior descending artery graft had to be
lengthened intraoperatively as it was somewhat tight at the time of
sternum closure. There were no persistent ST changes.
Postoperatively the patient did well. He had one event , which was
felt to be vasovagal in nature in which he had an episode of chest
tight and shortness of breath with diaphoresis. However , serial
enzymes and electrocardiograms were normal. This episode occurred
immediately after the patient had overheard a Code Blue on the
intercom , awakening him in the middle of the night. The patient
also had his discharge delayed for approximately 36 hours because
of a very low-grade temperature , which resolved prior to discharge.
He had minimal erythema of the proximal saphenous vein harvest
site , for which he was placed on ciprofloxacin 5 days
postoperatively in oral form.
