HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Hora is a 45 year old woman
with hypertensive disease , as well as
diabetes , who presents with sustained chest pain and shortness of
breath. The patient has long standing obesity with moderate to
severe hypertension which has been fairly well controlled and
poorly controlled diabetes , as well as atypical chest pain and
asthma. Over the last four days she has had increased episodes of
rather persistent chest discomfort , shortness of breath. She
generally describes it in her anterior chest wall as pressure , but
there is also some sharp qualities as well. The patient has also
noted increasing shortness of breath and dyspnea without subjective
wheezing and there has been an increase in her orthopnea. The
patient is unsure of whether her shortness of breath correlates
with her chest pressure. Previous evaluation has included several
negative exercise tolerance tests , but there was in 1981 an
exercise tolerance test with Thallium that showed a fixed anterior
profusion defect and an EKG has chronic anterolateral Q wave to
poor R wave progression. An echo in 1991 showed LVH with no
regional wall motion abnormalities. The patient was admitted for
rule out MI three months prior to this admission.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Asthma. 2. Hypertension. 3. Diabetes
mellitus. 4. Obesity. 5. Sleep apnea.
6. Peptic ulcer disease.
ALLERGIES: The patient has an allergy to Codeine which produces
nausea.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: 1. Diabetes mellitus. 2. Hypertension.
3. Family history of CAD. 4. No tobacco.
5. No hypercholesterolemia.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Notable for: 1. Hysterectomy vaginally.
2. Status post an umbilical hernia repair.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Azmacort , Proventil , Tagamet , Cardizem 300
q.day , insulin NPH 40 units q.AM and 55
units q.PM. , aspirin , Motrin , Maxide 1 per day , Lisinopril 20 mg
p.o. q.day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was afebrile , heart rate 100 ,
respiratory rate 20 , blood pressure was
140/80 , oxygen saturation was 99% on 2 liters. She was an obese
black female lying in the bed at 45 degrees with nasal cannula in
no acute distress. Her head was normocephalic atraumatic. Pupils
were equal and round to light and accommodation. Her extraocular
movements were full. Cranial nerves were intact. There were no
oral lesions. There was minimal jugular venous distention. Chest
was clear. Heart was regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs ,
rubs , or gallops. There was no CVA tenderness. There was some
chest wall tenderness on the left. The abdomen was obese and
non-tender , with bowel sounds present. There was no cyanosis ,
clubbing , or edema. There was no proprioceptive defects.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratories on admission showed her to have a
potassium of 3.7 , BUN and creatinine of 11/1.2 ,
creatinine kinase of 148 , troponin of 0.0. Chest x-ray was clear
with no evidence of left ventricular failure. EKG showed normal
sinus rhythm at 90 with Q waves/poor R wave progression in I , III ,
IV , which was no acute change from the most recent EKG.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and ruled out for a
myocardial infarction with serial CPK , as well as
serial troponin , both of which showed 0.0. The patient also
underwent a VQ scan given her sedentary life style to rule out
pulmonary embolus , and in fact it was very low probability. The
patient at that point was managed by the addition of a
gastrointestinal regimen of Prilosec and Cisapride as she had
complained of some worsening of her chest pressure when she laid
back flat and some sour taste in her mouth. The patient reported
that this combination of medications made her feel somewhat better.
The patient finally underwent an exercise tolerance test with MIBI
10/1/96. She went 5 minutes and 0 seconds on a Bruce protocol ,
stopped secondary to chest pain. Her peak heart rate was 140 ,
which is 85% of predicted. Her systolic maximum was 120. The
chest pressure was similar to that on admission and it was somewhat
atypical and ill defined. The patient then had MIBI images which
showed a borderline to minimal anterior reversible defect , but that
was as said borderline. The patient was deemed suitable for
discharge after conversation with Dr. Dubin of the Cardiology
Service , and the patient will be following up with her primary care
doctor. The medication changes will be the addition of Prilosec
and Cisapride in the place of Axid AND the addition of isordil 10mg po tid.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Proventil 2 puffs inhaler q.i.d. , enteric
coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day , NPH 40
units q.AM and 55 units subcu q.PM. , Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.day ,
Maxide 1 tablet p.o. q.day , nitroglycerin 1/150 1 tablet sublingual
q.5 minutes times three p.r.n. chest pain , Prilosec 20 mg p.o.
q.day , Azmacort 4 puffs inhaler b.i.d. , Cardizem CD 300 mg p.o.
q.day , Cisapride 10 mg p.o. q.i.d. , and isordil 10 mg po tid.
