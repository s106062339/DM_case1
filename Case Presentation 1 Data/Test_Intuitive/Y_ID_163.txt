morbid obesity , and anxiety who presents with chest tingling and SOB.
Pt was in her EBAMH until yesterday when after a large meal ,
late at night , she awoke with a strange feeling in her chest which
she could not describe - this feeling was associated with some air
hunger and mild nausea. No diaphoresis , radiation. Denies

** RELEVANT PMHX As in HPI

** Impression: 44F h/o DM2 , obesity , and anxiety d/o presents with
strange chest sensation. EKG , enzymes normal. MIBI showed severe perfusion
deficit , however , cardiac cath showed clean coronaries. Her symptoms could
still be explained by GERD or anxiety , with the perfusion deficit either aa
byproduct of the patient's size or caused by transient vasospasm.
*** Hospital Course and Plan by system
GI/FEN- Pt was maintained on 100U NPH , with lispro SS for meals. She had
intermittent reflux pains which were helped with H2 blocker. She should
continue on H2 blocker at home for these symptoms.
CV- cardiac enzymes x 2 were negative with no ischemic EKG changes. Stress
MIBI performed as inpatient with results as above. The study was limited
due the patient's size. D/C with ASA , BBlocker.
Resp- Baseline CXR - clear. No shortness of breath throughout her hospital
stay.
Renal- Cr 1.0 , eGFR 76. Her elevated Cr may reflect increased creatinine
production ( due to obesity ) vs. renal insufficiency.
Endo- Diabetes as above. Also h/o of hyperthyroidism , however , TSH and
free T4 were normal.
Pt was discharged from the hospital in stable condition. To follow-up with
Dr. Fischhaber in next two weeks.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please follow-up with your primary care physician in the next two weeks.
