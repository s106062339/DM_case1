Discharge Date: 9/1/2002
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 57-year-old status
post a massive gastrointestinal bleed
in April of 2001 who was transferred to the Gosroa Health Services
Hospital for a TIPS procedure which failed. She proceeded to go to
surgery at that time for a splenorenal shunt. She was recently
discharged from the Tonla Liha Measemillr Hospital And Clinic on August ,
2002. During the hospitalization , she had a complicating course
with encephalopathy , but she was able to be controlled with
lactulose and discharged to rehabilitation. She at that time also
had complications with infections for which she completed a course
of antibiotics. At rehabilitation , she was doing fairly well , but
her ammonia had been high. The highest was 196 on March ,
2002. The patient has also had increased confusion , increased
abdominal girth. When the daughters went in to visit her today ,
she was completely disoriented , complaining of abdominal pain. The
daughters also report subjective fevers and chills. At the
rehabilitation , her vital signs were notable for a blood pressure
of 94/60 , temperature 99.2. Per the daughters , the diet had not
been followed at rehabilitation and she was eating hot dogs. She
was also given benzodiazepines for sleep , up to 60-75 mg q. day of
Oxazepam. Per report , she had increased confusion and more acutely
in the last two days. In the emergency room on arrival , her blood
pressure was in the 120s , 98% on room air , she was febrile. She
was given levofloxacin , Flagyl and ampicillin. A Gastrointestinal
consult was called.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C , grade 4
esophageal varices , encephalopathy , status
post a frontal craniotomy , status post a motor vehicle accident
with a subdural hematoma , peptic ulcer disease.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER: Spironolactone 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
olanzapine unknown dose , Flagyl which she
had completed her course for Clostridium difficile , albuterol and
Atrovent nebulizers , lactulose 120 mg q.6h. , Lopressor 50 mg
t.i.d. , Serax 30 mg , Duragesic patch , Neomycin 2 grams q.i.d. ,
Oxazepam 30 mg q.h.s. and 15 mg q.8h. p.r.n.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with one of her daughters. She
has a remarkable history of tobacco for 30 years ,
one pack per day , recently quit.
FAMILY HISTORY: Non-contributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 101.1 , heart rate
99-120 , blood pressure 94-149/55-71 , oxygen
saturation 99% on room air. GENERAL: She was a well-nourished ,
well-developed lady who was confused and agitated. HEENT:
Remarkable for icteric sclera. LUNGS: Clear. CARDIOVASCULAR:
She had a regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 normal. Jugular
venous pressure was flat. ABDOMEN: Positive for bowel sounds ,
soft , but distended. She reports tenderness on palpation. RECTAL:
Guaiac-positive per emergency department. EXTREMITIES: Her right
lower extremity had erythema , painful to the touch , no warmth and
no cords. NEUROLOGICAL: Positive for asterixis. She was alert
and oriented to person , but not to time and confused about the
place. She was unable to carry on a conversation and unable to
keep attentive. Her strength was 5/5 and her sensation was intact.
LABORATORY: Laboratory data was remarkable for a sodium of 130 ,
potassium 4.9 , chloride 102 , bicarbonate 17 , BUN 9 ,
creatinine 0.8 and glucose 100. Her ALT was 16 , AST 72 , alkaline
phosphatase 118 , amylase 15 and lipase 33. Her ammonia level was
45 , albumin 3.2 , total bilirubin 2.4. Her hematocrit was 29.1.
Her INR was 1.4. EKG was normal sinus rhythm. Abdominal CT scan
showed that she had no abscess , no obstruction , no acute abdominal
process.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Gastrointestinal: At the time of admission ,
it was a confusing picture for increased
abdominal girth , however the CT scan showed that she had very
little ascites and on examination , little tenderness. Therefore ,
she got a paracentesis which was negative for spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis. The patient was treated with cefotaxime and Flagyl
for possible spontaneous bacterial peritonitis , continued on the
lactulose and her diuretics. However , the patient much improved
from the gastrointestinal standpoint and after resolution of her
infectious picture ( see below ) , the patient was doing incredibly
well with spironolactone and Lasix. She has not been able to
tolerate her beta blocker secondary to hypotension. During her
hospitalization , her hematocrit has been stable. A
gastrointestinal consult was obtained. I appreciate their input.
They recommend to follow up with the Transplant Team. She has an
appointment to see the Transplant Team on July , 2002. At this
time , it is recommended that she begin to get work-up for a liver
transplant. However , her hematocrit and her INR remained stable
throughout the hospitalization.
2 ) Infectious disease: The patient was negative for spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis , however on the second day of
hospitalization , she grew out 4/4 bottles with gram positive cocci
in pairs which speciated to be Streptococcus Group B. Therefore ,
the antibiotics were tailored and she was started on nafcillin
intravenously. The patient then had a PICC line placed and she
will continue treatment of two weeks with intravenous penicillin.
The patient has been doing very well with resolution of her
erythema. Infectious Disease Service consult was obtained. I
appreciate their input. They suggested two weeks of intravenous
penicillin.
3 ) Cardiovascular/hematology: Given the swelling of the leg , the
patient had lower extremity ultrasounds which were negative for
clot. Otherwise , she remained in normal sinus rhythm and no
symptoms of congestive heart failure.
4 ) Psychiatry: The patient was very confused , most likely
delirium. Psychiatry input was greatly appreciated. Another
reason for her confusion was the fact that she was getting much
benzodiazepines at her rehabilitation before. She was weaned off
her benzodiazepines and started on olanzapine and titrated up as
tolerated. Therefore , we highly recommend avoiding benzodiazepines
in this patient and continue with olanzapine which can take p.r.n.
as well as needed.
5 ) Vascular: Vascular Surgery followed this patient during her
hospitalization and deemed that her splenorenal shunt was working
well with no evidence of leak.
DISPOSITION: The patient is sent to rehabilitation for further
treatment and finishing of her antibiotic course. At
this point , she has requested a new primary care physician and this
will be myself. I will follow her with an appointment in July ,
which I have scheduled for her.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Nexium 20 mg p.o. q. day , olanzapine 5
mg p.o. q. PM and olanzapine 2.5 mg p.o.
q.8h. p.r.n. , Atrovent inhalers , Azmacort , spironolactone 100 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , penicillin 3 million units intravenously q.4h. for a
complete course of two weeks , Nico-Derm 14 mg a day topical ,
Lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. which is to be held if her systolic
blood pressure is less than 100 , lactulose 30 ml p.o. t.i.d. ,
Motrin p.r.n. for pain and Lasix 40 mg p.o. q. day.
