***********
ASSESSMENT: 42F c multiple encounters with medical system for evaluation
of abdominal pain/ atypical cp admitted for workup of these issues.
1.GI: The differential diagnosis of the patient's abdominal
pain included PUD and enteritis/colitis. She was placed on BID
PPI and Maalox/Benadryl/Lidocaine for possible GERD pain. Narcotics
and anxiolytics were held for previous h/o narcotic seeking behavior ,
and the patient was agreeable. Her loose stools resolved , with no sample
available for stool culture , fecal leukocytes , fecal fat , C diff or
Guaiac. EGD showed normal gastric pouch and no evidence for ulcers or
other pathology that would explain her pain. She was discharged on her
home PPI.
2.CV: i- The patient has had extensive workup for atypical chest pain in
the past. She was ruled out for MI with neg cardiac biomarkers x 3 , and
was continued on her home beta blocker.
p- The patient had low blood pressures with SBP in the 80's on 7/18 ,
increased to 90's to 100's with fluids. Low blood pressure was possibly
due to fluid depletion from diarrhea and high atenolol dose. Atenolol
100 mg was converted to Lopressor 12.5 mg q6h with SBP in the 120's. She
will be discharged on atenolol 25 mg , to be titrated up by her PCP as
needed.
r- The patient had prolonged qtc of 509 ms ( slightly up from up from
480's in the past ) , with no obvious medications that would contribute.
No QT prolonging medications were given.
3. HEME: The patient has long standing anemia with baseline Hct in
mid-30's. Admission Hct was 42 , decreased to 34.9 with IV hydration and
remained stable ~35 thereafter. There was no evidence of GI bleed on EGD.
4.RHEUM: The patient has low back pain , with diffuse body pain and ESR
74. PMR is on the differential , and she will follow-up with Rheumatology
as an outpatient.
