ATTENDING: FLATTERY , SHAD SANTO MD
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:
Decompensated heart failure and hyponatremia.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Congestive heart failure.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Transfer from outside hospital for decompensated heart failure
and hyponatremia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 65-year-old female with nonischemic cardiomyopathy ,
diabetes , obesity with ICD/biventricular pacer , CHF with EF of
15% was admitted to an outside hospital initially for a fall and
was subsequently found to have decompensated heart failure and
hyponatremia. The patient was then transferred to Memoff Deelaen's Hospital for further treatment. At the time of the fall , the
patient was not presyncopal , likely due to possibly feeling weak.
At the hospital , the patient received p.o. Lasix and then IV
Lasix with little success in treating CHF. The patient was found
to have sodium level of 117 , hydrochlorothiazide was then
withheld and the patient was restricted on fluids. Of note , the
patient comes in on Coumadin therapy secondary to having a CVA in
10/5 with no residual symptoms while off Coumadin. The
patient denies any history of chest pain , shortness of breath ,
palpitations , however , the patient knows that he has had
increasing dyspnea on exertion and weakness. She also notes some
swelling and difficulty lying completely flat.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
This is a 65-year-old female with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy ,
CHF with EF of 15% and on a biventricular pacer , ICD , diabetes ,
obesity , admitted from outside hospital for treatment of
hyponatremia and decompensated heart failure.
1. Cardiovascular:
A. Pump: The patient initially was in significant decompensated
heart failure. As a result , the patient was immediately started
on diuretics with torsemide IV 100 mg twice a day with a goal of
-1 to -2 liters daily. Daily weights and strict I & Os were
monitored daily. The patient was also placed on 1 liter free
water restriction and 2 liters fluid restriction. Digoxin levels
were shown to be in normal range. The patient was continued on
digoxin , Isordil , and thiazides were held secondary to patient's
hyponatremia. Over the hospital course , the patient's
hyponatremia improved significantly and gradually back up in to
the 130s. The patient continued to diurese well initially with a
weight of 83.5 kilograms. At the time of discharge , the
patient's weight was approximately 273 kilograms. The patient
also continued to show much improvement in terms of energy level.
Subjectively , the patient felt better. Zestril was also slowly
added to patient's CHF regimen. At the time of discharge ,
Zestril 10 mg per day was added. A beta-blocker was also added ,
specifically Coreg at 3.125 mg twice daily , Aldactone 25 mg once
daily was also added to the regimen. In terms of diuresis
initially , the patient was on 100 mg b.i.d. p.o. torsemide and at
one point was switched to Lasix drip as the patient was not
responding to diuretics. Eventually the patient was transitioned
back to an oral regimen with torsemide ultimately at 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d.
Echocardiogram was also performed which showed significant mitral
regurgitation with reversal of flow in the pulmonary venous
system. As a result , there was consideration and discussion
about mitral valve replacement. The patient is amenable to
procedure performed by Dr. Mcgrue This will be discussed and
coordinated by his office and him. This will be a percutaneous
procedure possibly.
The patient's electrolytes were monitored twice daily as the
patient was actively being diuresed. Electrolytes were repleted
p.r.n.
B. Rhythm: The patient has no active arrhythmias. However , the
patient's ICD and biventricular pacemaker was found to be towards
end of life and required replacement. As a result , although not
urgent during this admission , ICD/biventricular pacer was
replaced by Dr. Neuse on 4/20/05. The patient tolerated the
procedure very well with no complications. The patient's ICD
pocket was checked for any signs of pocket hematoma or other
complications. The patient is stable and new ICD/pacer is
functioning properly. No signs of bleeding or infection.
C. Ischemia: There are no active issues. EKGs demonstrated no
signs of cardiac ischemia. The patient was chest pain free
throughout the hospitalization.
2. Endocrine: The patient's home regimen was held and the
patient was continued only on a insulin sliding scale after meals
and at bedtime. Fingersticks demonstrated good sugar control.
Fingersticks were managed mostly between 100 and 120.
3. FEN: The patient was on diabetic diet. The patient was also
checked twice daily for electrolytes and repleted for magnesium
and potassium scale. Sodium was also monitored as the patient
was initially admitted for hyponatremia. As a result , all
thiazides were held.
4. Hematology: The patient had a home dose of Coumadin 5 mg
Monday , Wednesday , Friday. The patient's regimen was continued
as inpatient and was slightly modified eventually to
approximately 2 to 2.5 mg once daily. INR was maintained
therapeutic throughout the hospitalization. ICD replacement
procedure per Dr. Bjella The patient was continued with the
foal INR between 2.0 to 2.5.
5. Psyche/Neuro: Continued patient's home regimen of Xanax ,
Neurontin and pain medication to control chronic back pain.
6. Prophylaxis: For DVT prophylaxis , the patient was on Coumadin
with therapeutic INR. For GI prophylaxis , the patient was placed
on Nexium.
Physical therapy consult was also called to evaluate the
patient's functional status. The patient also underwent regular
physical therapy sessions inhouse to improve functional status.
ID: The patient's UA demonstrated possible evidence for urinary
tract infection. This may also have contributed to patient's
decompensated heart failure and also initial complaints of
feeling weak. Urine culture demonstrated that the patient had
citrobacter that was sensitive to ciprofloxacin. As a result ,
the patient was started on a course of ciprofloxacin. The
patient was also placed in isolation as the strain was resistant
to gentamicin. The patient after treatment was taken off contact
isolation. The patient was afebrile. Vital signs were stable
with no complaints of dysuria , chills , or fevers throughout
hospitalization. Subsequent UA demonstrated evidence that
urinary tract infection was adequately treated.
DISPOSITION:
The patient to follow up with home cardiologist within one to two
weeks. After discharge , the patient will also follow up with Dr.
Iturbe to discuss further treatment of mitral valve
regurgitation. After Coumadin follow up and INR blood draws , the
patient will follow up with primary care doctor.
