BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
78 yo man who presents with 2 episodes of SSCP. Recently had MV and TV
repair with SVG to OM1. Reported to have 80% diag , 70% LCX from a cath
in Ohio in 3/1 Also h/o HTN , DM 2 ( diet controlled ) , AF ,
ventricular pacemaker , ischemic CMP , EF 30%. CP occurred while at
rest , no radiation and no associated symptoms. 1st episode was 10/8 ,
resolved spontaneously. Came to ED , EKG was paced , CK flat , TnI
elevated at 0.17 , similar to value on 4/21 when pt came in for a TIA.
Mr. Faiella was sent home with sl nitro. Pain occurred again while
watching TV , resolved with one sl nitro. Was admitted for workup of
possible ischemia. Currently CP free.
1. CV: Ischemia: ruled out for MI , added isordil to regimen , ASA.
Continue carvedilol , captopril. Likely to have CAD , Adenosine MIBI
revealed fixed inf/lat defect , consistent with LCX disease. No
reversible defects. Since chest pain is unlikely to be cardiac in
origin , will stop nitrates. Pt was able to amubulate w/o SOB or CP

2. Endo: DM 2 , diet controlled. HbA1C 5.8%
