CHIEF COMPLAINT: 63 year old female with hypertension , diabetes
mellitus , coronary artery disease , who presents
two days status post a syncopal episode in the setting of chest
pain. Her cardiac risk factors are hypertension , diabetes
mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , postmenopausal , and she has no
family history of coronary artery disease , and denies the use of
tobacco. Her cardiac history is as follows: She has a history of
chronic stable angina. She underwent a cardiac catheterization in
January of 1992 notable for 75% OM2 lesion , 50% ostial right RCA
lesion , and ejection fraction at the time was 75%. She had an ETT
performed in September of 1994 which she exercised for 3 minutes 42
seconds with a peak heart rate of 127 , systolic blood pressure of
156 , rate pressure product of 20k. She was stopped secondary to
chest pain , she had some T wave inversions in the inferolateral
leads felt to be consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia.
She also had an echocardiogram performed in August of 1994 with
an ejection fraction of 60-65% , no regional wall motion
abnormalities. She has been followed in the ONNAW HOSPITAL Clinic by Dr.
Stenehjem , maintained on the regimen of Isordil 40 mg t.i.d. ,
Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Captopril 25 mg t.i.d. , enteric coated
aspirin , and Procardia XL 60 mg q.day. She reports her angina has
been stable for years. She takes 1-2 sublingual nitroglycerin per
week. Her pain is typically precipitated by brisk walking or other
forms of exercises. She reports that her daily workout consists of
some situps three times a day , and also usually a walk. She states
that two days prior to admission while walking her normal speed
towards the bus station , she developed some right chest wall
tightness and shortness of breath consistent with her typical
angina. She was in the middle of the street , decided to walk
across the street with the plan to take a sublingual nitroglycerin ,
however she felt light headed on continued ambulation and had a
syncopal episode. She reports that on awakening she had no
confusion. She did report the loss of urine incontinence but has
urinary incontinence at baseline. She denies any stool
incontinence , no seizure activity per observers. No complications
prior to the episode. She denies any orthopnea or PND at baseline.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Notable for coronary artery disease , as
above. 2. Hypertension. 3. Diabetes
mellitus , she is on insulin. 4. Hypercholesterolemia. 5.
Hypothyroidism. 6. History of guaiac positive stools. 7.
History of a frozen shoulder. 8. Vitamin B 12 deficiency. 9.
Gallstone disease. 10. Urinary incontinence. 11. History of a
cystocele.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Isordil 40 mg t.i.d. , NPH insulin 66 units
q.AM and 15 units q.PM , Procardia XL 60 mg
q.day , metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d. , vitamin B 12 1 mg IM q.month ,
Captopril 25 mg t.i.d. , Synthroid .125 mg q.day , aspirin 325 mg
q.day , p.r.n. sublingual nitroglycerin.
FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for coronary artery disease. Positive
for diabetes mellitus in her mother and her
daughter. Also positive for lung cancer.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives in Ral , Pennsylvania 83011 alone , no pets. She has
ten children , 32 grandchildren , and 4 great
grandchildren. She denies any use of tobacco or denies any use of
alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs showed a temperature of 98.9 ,
heart rate of 78 , blood pressure 160/90 ,
respiratory rate of 20 , with a room air saturation of 93%. In
general , obese black female in no apparent distress. HEENT
examination was PERRL , EOMI , neck supple , full range of motion , she
had a soft carotid bruit on the left , no bruits on the right , and
2+ pulses bilaterally. Lungs were clear. Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a soft grade
1/6 systolic ejection murmur , best heard at the left lower sternal
border. Abdomen had positive bowel sounds , non-tender ,
nondistended. She was guaiac negative. Extremities showed no
clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. 2+ femoral pulses , no bruits. 2+
dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. Neurologic examination
was grossly nonfocal.
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: EKG on admission showed a heart rate of 73 ,
intervals of .164 , .076 , .049 seconds for PR ,
QRS , and QTC. Axis was 71. No Q waves and no acute ST or T wave
changes.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 103 ,
bicarb 25 , BUN and creatinine of 16 and
1.3 , glucose of 282. LFTs were within normal limits. CK of 213 ,
cholesterol 179. Other labs showed a TSH of 1.5 , ferritin 181 ,
TIBC of 226 , troponin I was 0.0 , hematocrit was 39.4 , white count
7.15 , platelet count of 348 , 000. Coagulation studies were within
normal limits. Urinalysis showed 2-4 WBCs , 3+ bacteria. Her urine
culture revealed 50 , 000 suspected enteric gram negative rods. This
is a urine culture from 7/24/96. A chest x-ray revealed no
infiltrates.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CARDIAC: Cardiac wise , she ruled out for an MI by enzymes and
EKG. She underwent a standard Bruce protocol ETT on 7/10/96. She
exercised for 8 minutes , stopped secondary to fatigue. Maximum
heart rate was 95 , maximum blood pressure 170/75. She developed
typical angina in her recovery which spontaneously resolved. She
had 1 mm down sloping ST segment depressions in II , III , F , V4
through V6 , which resolved into recovery. These changes were
suggestive of ischemia , but less specific because of her baseline
LVH. She subsequently underwent a cardiac catheterization on
7/28/96 , revealing a 40% left main with 90% mid RCA , 90% stenosis at
the origin of the PDA , 30% mid LAD , and 50% OM2. She subsequently
underwent angioplasty of the RCA and the PDA lesion on 4/1/96 with
some mild haze at the PDA. Therefore , recommendations were for
heparinization for a 24 hour period. She remained pain free
throughout this hospitalization. The EPS Service saw her regarding
the issue of syncope. Further workup was performed including
carotid ultrasounds which revealed no significant stenosis in
either of the carotid arteries. She underwent a cardiac
echocardiogram on 2/4/96 to rule out evidence of regional wall
motion abnormality that might suggest the possibility of a prior MI
as a source of potential ectopy. She was noted to have 2+ mitral
regurgitation , noted to have an ejection fraction of 74% , and had
no reported regional wall motion abnormality. She also had no
arrhythmias while on monitors throughout the hospitalization. The
EPS Service agreed with the thought that the ischemia in the RCA
probably was the most likely etiology of her syncopal episodes with
possible bradycardia during ischemic episodes. They favored
holding off on the EPS study. They felt that the revascularization
and follow-up stress testing were the recommended workup for this
patient and recommendations are for follow-up ETT in four to six
weeks. Her medical regimen was adjusted in the form of increasing
her Lopressor from 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. to 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. as her
rate and blood pressure tolerated this regimen. She remained pain
free throughout the hospitalization. She will have follow-up with
her primary M.D.
2. DIABETES MELLITUS: Her glucose remained under fairly good
control during this hospitalization with her regimen of NPH.
Hemoglobin A1C was checked and is pending at the time of discharge.
3. URINARY: She was noted to have 3+ bacteria on her urinalysis
and 50 , 000 colony forming units on a urine culture of 7/24/96. We
will empirically treat her for a UTI with Bactrim 1 DS b.i.d. times
three days.
FOLLOW-UP: Follow-up will be with Dr. Amous She is to have an
appointment in one to two weeks. She is also to have a
follow-up ETT in four to six weeks. She should also have a repeat
urine culture in the NECTON BRYIN HAWEIR HEALTH Clinic during her follow-up.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day ,
Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Isordil 40 mg
t.i.d. , Synthroid .125 micrograms q.day , metoprolol 100 mg b.i.d. ,
Procardia XL 60 mg q.day , nitroglycerin .4 mg p.r.n. , NPH insulin
66 units q.AM and 15 units subcu q.PM , and Bactrim 1 DS p.o. b.i.d.
times three days.
DISPOSITION: Discharge to home.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Good. Her diet should be low fat , low
cholesterol ADA diet. Activity as
tolerated.
COMPLICATIONS DURING HOSPITALIZATION: None.
