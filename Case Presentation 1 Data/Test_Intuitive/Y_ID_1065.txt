PREOPERATIVE LABS: Sodium 143 , potassium 4.5 , chloride 104 ,
bicarbonate 30 , BUN 45 , creatinine 1.6 , glucose 87 , magnesium
2.2 , BNP 18 , white blood cell count 8 , hematocrit 35.2 ,
hemoglobin 11.9 , platelets 313 , PT 13.7 , INR 1 , and PTT 31.5.
Carotid imaging: Left and right internal carotid arteries , both
with 0% occlusion. Cardiac catheterization performed at Iland Frenchcal Clami General Hospital on 10/18/06 showed stenosis in the following
coronary arteries: 70% proximal PDA , 90% proximal LAD , 70% mid
circumflex with right dominant circulation. Ventriculogram
showed an ejection fraction of 35%. EKG on 4/5/06 showed
normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 63. There was poor
R-wave progression in the precordial leads and inverted T waves
in leads III , V5 and V6. Chest x-ray on 4/5/06 was consistent
with congestive heart failure and an enlarged cardiac silhouette.
There is mild CHF , bilateral atelectasis.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on the day prior to
her scheduled surgery for completion of her preoperative workup.
On 5/26/06 , she was brought to the operating room where Dr.
Gonzale performed a CABG x3 using the LIMA to bypass the LAD and
saphenous vein graft to bypass the OM1 and saphenous vein graft
to bypass the PDA. The cardiopulmonary bypass time was 107
minutes and the aortic cross-clamp time was 83 minutes. The vein
was harvested from both legs. The patient was transferred to the
Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit after her surgery where she remained
intubated for two days due to poor lung
compliance. She was also hypotensive in the postoperative period
and treated with vasoactive medications. By postoperative day
#2 , the patient was extubated and hemodynamically stable ,
however , she experienced atrial fibrillation overnight and her
Lopressor was increased. By post-operative day #3 , her atrial fibrillation
was rate controlled and she was started on Coumadin. By
postoperative day #4 , she was ready for transfer from the ICU to
the Step-Down Unit. At that point , she was neurologically intact
and her pain was well controlled. She was being treated with
beta-blockers and Coumadin for AFib. From a respiratory
perspective , the patient was being treated with aggressive
pulmonary toilet and chest PT. Her chest x-ray showed a small
right pleural effusion and she was oxygenating well with
supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. The patient's diet was
advanced as tolerated and she exhibited adequate urine output.
The patient was treated with Lasix for postoperative fluid
retention. She also was seen by the Diabetes Management Service
throughout her postoperative stay for optimal glycemic control.
On the step-down Unit on postoperative day #5 , the patient
experienced a bradycardic incident with a heart rate of 38 and
she became hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/50 after her
diltiazem was increased. She was transferred back to the
Intensive Care Unit where she was observed for three more days.
During that time , the patient's hemodynamics stabilized although
she remained in rate controlled atrial fibrillation. On
postoperative day #8 , she was ready again to transfer back to the
Step-Down Unit where she spent the remaining six days of her
hospital stay. The patient's chest x-ray suggested that she was
volume overloaded and the patient was aggressively treated with
Lasix and Zaroxolyn as her creatinine began to increase slowly
from 1.3 to 1.5 to 1.7. The diuretics were decreased. A chest
ultrasound to evaluate pleural effusion for thoracentesis
revealed that the patient had considerable atelectasis and
minimal effusion. The focus then became on chest PT , pulmonary
toilet and deep breathing and coughing. The patient continued to
ambulate with physical therapy and by postoperative day #13 , the
patient's chest x-ray showed improvement of the atelectasis in
the right lung and the patient had decreased oxygen requirements.
From a cardiac perspective in the Step-Down Unit , the patient
was in atrial fibrillation from postoperative days #9 through #11
and then converted to a sinus rhythm where she remained for the
final three days of her hospital stay. The patient had been
started on Coumadin for her postoperative atrial fibrillation and
this medication should continue at least until she follow up with
a cardiologist in an outpatient setting to reevaluated her heart
rhythm. By postoperative day #14 , the patient was in a sinus
rhythm with a stable blood pressure. She was oxygenating well on
room air and was ambulating effectively on her own. She had no
complaints and was ready for discharge to home. On that day , her
temperature was 96.4 degrees , heart rate 76 and sinus rhythm ,
blood pressure 110/60 , respiratory rate 18 , O2 saturation 94% on
room air. The patient was seven kilograms below her preoperative
weight.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.
DISPOSITION: Discharged to home with VNA Services.
DISCHARGE DIET: A low-cholesterol , low-saturated fat 2100
calorie per day , 4 gm sodium per day diet.
ACTIVITY: The patient should be walking as tolerated and elevate
her feet with prolonged periods of sitting.
FOLLOWUP APPOINTMENTS: The patient should arrange followup
appointments with her cardiologist Dr. Micheal Moresco at
051-469-9935 in one to two weeks. She should also see Elmo Renigar , NP in the diabetes Clinic in one to two weeks. Her
phone number is 870-378-1192 yezmxafcp 1. Finally , the patient
should see her cardiac surgeon , Dr. Greg Mumbower at 869-541-1864
in four to six weeks. The patient should arrange her followup
appointments as indicated , and upon return home to S Rance Saph ,
she should followup with either her primary care physician or
cardiologist who will follow her in the future.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Acetaminophen 325 mg take one to two tablets every four hours
as needed for pain.
2. Enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg daily.

subcutaneously.
7. Lovastatin 20 mg p.o. daily.
8. Toprol-XL 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.
9. Oxycodone 5 mg p.o. q.4 h. p.r.n. pain.
10. Aldactone 25 mg daily.
11. Coumadin , the patient should take 3.5 mg on the evening of
10/28/06. The VNA should draw an INR on 10/4/06 and future
Coumadin dosing will vary for an INR goal of 2 to 3 and will
managed by the Diabetes Management Service at Downwell Verview Medical Center Their phone number is 915-360-5305.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient's vital signs should be
monitored as well as her wound for signs or symptoms of
infection. The patient should shower daily and keep her
incisions clean and dry. The patient should breath deeply and
cough to open her lungs. She should continue to ambulate
frequently. The patient should be weighed daily and a physician
should be contacted if her weight , peripheral edema or work of
breathing noted to be increasing. The patient should continue to
take Coumadin as directed at least until follow-up with a
cardiologist.
