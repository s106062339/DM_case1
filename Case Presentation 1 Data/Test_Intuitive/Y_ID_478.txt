Discharge Date: 9/24/1990
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1 ) APLASTIC ANEMIA.
2 ) ANTITHROMBOCYTE GLOBULIN THERAPY FOR 10
DAYS.
3 ) OTITIS MEDIA.
4 ) SERUM SICKNESS.
5 ) HIV NEGATIVE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 26-year-old woman
who has a 15 year history of aplastic
anemia without known cause and history of multiple transfusions
admitted for ATG trial. The patient was diagnosed with aplastic
anemia in 1976 at Phhealt Hospital when admitted for epistaxis ,
unknown workup , unknown cause. Denies drug or chemical exposure or
infection. Hct 30 , platelets 100 , 000 , white cell count ran at
around 4000. She was diagnosed at the time with mild aplastic
anemia. No treatment was given. The patient in past has declined
further treatment and often was found to be non-compliant in the
past. Evidently the patient has an HLA identical brother which was
found out during earlier diagnosis. She has a history of brief
trial of androgen treatment. On 14 of September her white count was 2.5 ,
Hct 19.6 , platelets 5000 , MCV 96 , polys 10 , lymphs 87 which is
similar to baseline but platelets are usually more around 10 , 000.
She is maintained on q three week transfusions without platelets.
She is now admitted for ATGAM therapy. The patient has been noted
to be more compliant with transfusions recently than in the past
and has been requiring them more but this may be secondary to her
increased compliance and increased activity. The patient was in
her usual state of health with a cough secondary to smoking and
white sputum. No headache , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , fever ,
chills , night sweats , dysuria , urine or bowel movement changes. No
history of cauterization for epistaxis. Positive easy
bruisability , gum bleed without trauma , and last episode of
epistaxis on 17 of September which is four days prior to admission which
lasted 45 to 50 minutes. Her last menstrual period was the third
week of 10 of October .  She had no menometrorrhagia and she has nausea with
her menses. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Last month she stopped birth
control pill secondary to non-compliance and uses condoms
otherwise. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for Gravida VI Para III
AB III , twins times one. Last pregnancy in 8 of September , discontinued
secondary to birth abnormality. She has a 15 year history of
aplastic anemia and has been previously tested HIV and HPV
negative. SOCIAL HISTORY: Notable for cocaine use , smoking ,
approximately three times a week; alcohol one pint of hard liquor a
week; smoking one half to one pack per day. She lives with her
father , uncle , and three children and occasionally works at
Do Rochealesall Wia
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Notable for an obese pleasant woman in no
apparent distress. Temperature 99.3 , pulse
88 , blood pressure 130/80 , respirations 20. HEENT was notable for
being anicteric , fundi were flat , no adenopathy , JVD , bruits or
increased thyroid. Heart with II/VI systolic ejection murmur at
left sternal border. Lungs were clear. No CVA tenderness. Abdomen
with bowel sounds present , liver 10 cm , no guarding or rebound , no
spleen , mass or kidneys palpable. Extremities non-tender , 1+ edema
at ankle , right ankle more than the left ankle. Neuro exam within
normal limits.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission notable for white count 2.4 , Hct
21.7 , MCV 91.8 , platelet count 15 , 000;
differential was polys 7 , bands 1 , lymphs 92. SMA 7 on admission
was sodium 139 , potassium 3.8 , bicarb 22 , glucose 82 , BUN 10 ,
creatinine 0.9 with anion gap 10. LFTs revealed OT 66 , PT 102 , LDH
221 , alk phos 111 , bili 0.3/0.2 , calcium 8.5. Cholesterol 143 ,
triglyceride 113. HIV was negative. HPV was negative. HCV was
negative. Beta HCG was negative.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient received a 10 day course of ATGAM
complicated by , during the first day , temperature
to 105 with response to holding ATGAM and starting hydrocortisone
and restarting ATGAM. She was afebrile without symptoms until day
nine of ATGAM when a rash became apparent starting on her right
forearm with a rectangular red erythematous maculopapular patch
which later extended over her entire body and it was pruritic. No
involvement of her orpharynx and no respiratory compromise were
ever noted. This may have been partly secondary either to her
ATGAM being turned up on the night of 6 of March by the patient by
accident or also may have been due to Ceftaz and Vanco which was
started on 6 of March for a febrile episode on the eighth day of
ATGAM. She was also noted during the episode of fever to have an
erythematous eardrum , a couple of posterior cervical nodes one
measuring about 1 cm x 2 cm which was tender to palpation , also
some erythema of the right side of her oropharynx. Strep was
negative. The patient was treated with Ceftaz and Vanc for
possible otitis. This was later changed to Augmentin when rash was
thought to be possibly secondary to Ceftaz and then this again was
changed later to po Cipro when she was no longer neutropenic and
her symptoms appeared to be resolving. During the episode of the
rash her urine also changed to a dark coke-colored urine which
contained red blood cells , no casts were noted , however , it was
felt to be consistent with serum sickness and so the patient was
changed from the 40 mg prednisone started for the ATGAM so that she
would be afebrile and to minimize reaction of the ATGAM to IV Solu
Medrol. She responded well to this with urine changing rapidly to
yellow color still with some RBCs on discharge , however , she will
be discharged on 16 mg prednisone po bid and followed up in
Hematology to make sure the rash continues to fade and that her
urine continues to improve. During hospitalization the patient
required periodic transfusions for platelets and packed red blood
cells. She tolerated the packed red blood cell transfusion well ,
however , in general she noted her usual reaction to platelets with
rigors and chills and was given hydrocortisone 100 mg IV at the
same time. Also while using Solu Medrol one night prior to
admission she was given one bag of platelets for which she
developed a little bit of an increased rash which faded rapidly on
stopping the platelets and a platelet blood transfusion reaction
workup was done. The labs on discharge are sodium 135 , potassium
4.8 , BUN 20 , creatinine 1 , LDH 327 , alk phos 263 , magnesium 2.1 ,
calcium 9.4 , white blood cell count 2.4 with 36 polys , 1 band , 55
lymphs , and 8 monos , Hct 27.6 , and platelet count 7000 prior to one
bag of platelets , MCV 88.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Nystatin 5 cc po qid prn , 60
mg prednisone po bid , 1 gm Carafate po qid , calcium
carbonate 2500 mg po tid , Ciprofloxacin 750 mg po bid for 10 days ,
chlorhexadine glucose 15 cc po bid , Benadryl 25 mg po qid prn ,
Monistat cream for question of monoliasis , and Tylenol prn. Please
note that prednisone dosage is to be adjusted in Transfusion
Services on 1 of November as per need. The patient is stable on
discharge. The patient is to return to Transfusion Service on
