abdominal pain. Prior stool studies ( - ) , received imodium for symptomatic
relief , sent repeat stool cx--at time of discharge , stool O+P and fecal
leukocytes ( - ). C. diff , stool cultures pending. Had completely normal
abdominal CT 1 month ago for identical symptomatology , only able to
obtain abd CT without contrast due to IV dye allergy. Symptoms resolved
spontaneously by time of discharge--will discharge on reglan and imodium
for symptomatic relief , with GI outpatient follow-up at Sampdesys Medical Center
on 4/18/05 with Dr. Armand Leventhal for further evaluation of chronic
diarrhea and mild RLQ tenderness. ?poor sugar control contributing to
symptoms of nausea , abdominal pain. Patient feels that one of the

related to hyperglycemia and gastroparesis

( 5 ) Psych: renal service requested psych evaluation for ?secondary gain;

depressed , probably has some element of PTSD from watching brother-in-law
decapitate an acquaintance when she was 15yo; grandson also died a few
years ago in a house fire--unable to watch news on TV subsequently. No
evidence of secondary gain--felt that moving to assisted living facility
in 1 month will be beneficial for her--no need for any psych meds at this
time. Also evaluated by Spanish-speaking social worker , who knows Ms.
Oka well , extremely helpful in outlining home situation , issues.
