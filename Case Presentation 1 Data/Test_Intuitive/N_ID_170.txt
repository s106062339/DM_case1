Discharge Date: 9/21/2005
ATTENDING: VAL YAFAIE M.D.
This discharge summary covers admission 7/30/05 until 9/26/05
PRIMARY ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Congestive heart failure.
OTHER MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS: Familial cardiomyopathy.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 36-year-old
man with familial cardiomyopathy and a last ejection fraction of
50% well known to the heart failure service secondary to multiple
admissions for decompensated CHF in the setting of poor medical
and dietary compliance presents with gradual fatigue and
increasing abdominal girth , orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea , and feeling "fluid overloaded." He denies any chest
pain , fevers , chills , or other symptoms.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Familial cardiomyopathy , history of an
AICD placed in 2001 , last ejection fraction of 50% with a
biventricular pacing , and severe mitral and tricuspid
regurgitation.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 0.125 , Isordil 30 t.i.d. ,
spironolactone 25 b.i.d. , torsemide 200 p.o. b.i.d. , K-Dur 20
once a day , and folate 5 once a day.
ALLERGIES: ACE inhibitors cause a cough and rash and lisinopril
causes cough.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient smoked 2 packs per day times
approximately 10 years and drinks occasional ethanol. He denies
any history of other drug use. He is married and is with 2
children. He does not work currently secondary to his
cardiomyopathy. He also has a brother who is status post cardiac
transplant.
EXAMINATON DATA: Temperature 96 , Pulse 97 , blood pressure 90/70 ,
and oxygen saturation 97 on room air. Admission weight 83.8
kilograms. JVP was greater than the angle of the jaw. Cardiac
exam was regular rate and rhythm with 2/6 systolic murmur at the
apex. Respiratory exam showed a few bibasilar rales. Abdomen
was distended with mild shifting dullness. There was trace
bilateral extremity edema.
LABORATORY VALUES: Creatinine 1.5 , sodium 129 , potassium 2.7 ,
magnesium 2.2 , ALT 32 , AST 31 , hematocrit 40.6 , white blood cell
count 7.3 , platelets 281 , INR 1.2 , PTT 35.4 , and BNP 594.
INITIAL ASSESSMENT: This is a 36-year-old man with familial
cardiomyopathy admitted for CHF exacerbation.
Problem#1. Cardiovascular: The patient was admitted in
decompensated failure. He reports compliance with his
medications; however , likely some component of this
decompensation is secondary to dietary indiscretion with foods
and fluids. The patient was diuresed during his hospital stay
initially with intravenous torsemide; however , this was
unsuccessful and a Lasix drip with BNP drip was started on
hospital day #3. He reached a total weight loss of approximately
2 to 3 kilograms and was converted to oral medicines including
torsemide. Moreover , he failed to maintain a stable weight on
this regimen and ultrafiltration was attempted. That removed
approximately 900 cc of fluids. This failed secondary to
intravenous access clotting and the patient's frustration with
having to lying still. The patient was subsequently converted to
oral torsemide and metolazone , torsemide 200 b.i.d. , metolazone 5
b.i.d. , and spironolactone 25 b.i.d. as an oral regimen. Per the
patient's request and reaching a somewhat adequate goal with this
hospitalization , the patient requested to be discharged. He
reported that he would follow up with the CHF nursing staff and
with Dr. Adamski and although we repeatedly stressed the importance
of free water restriction and fluid restriction , he continued to
be noncompliant with this while inhouse. At the time the patient
was discharged , it was felt that he was not optimal
hemodynamically , but had excellent followup plans and stated that
he would return if his condition worsened.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 0.125 once a day , Isordil 10
t.i.d. metolazone 5 b.i.d. , spironolactone 25 b.i.d. , torsemide
200 b.i.d. , and K-Dur 60 b.i.d.
There are no pending studies at the time of discharge. The
patient will follow up with the CHF nurse in approximately 2 days
and see Dr. Weyhrauch in clinic within 1 week.
