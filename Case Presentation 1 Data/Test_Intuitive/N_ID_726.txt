HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.DYSPNEA: The patient presented with increased dyspnea on exertion ,
likely secondary to CHF with preserved ejection fraction. Her EKG was
without changes from prior and her cardiac enzymes were cycled and
negative x3. She was given 40mg IV lasix with approx 2L diuresis daily.
Her weight at discharge was 127.3kg. Her admission weight was 131.5kg.
She had an ECHO which showed an EF of 55% and 1-2+MR with slightly
elevated PA pressure. This was unchanged from her previous ECHO in 2003.
Her CXR did not show any acute process. She had a DDimer of 2300. LENIS
showed no evidence of a DVT and on 7/18 she had a CT with PE protocol which
showed no evidence of a DVT or PE. She was given mucomyst for this for
renal protection. She was continued on her CPAP for OSA.
2. HTN: The patient was continued on her avapro and Imdur. Her diltiazem
and atenolol doses were decreased as she was having bradycardia with rates
in the 40s on the first day of her hospital stay.
3. CAD: The patient was continued on her imdur , beta blocker , and aspirin.
Her plavix was held as she was holding this as an outpatient for upcoming
cataract surgery. Her last stent was 2001 and she was given permission by
her outpatient cardiologist to hold this.
4. DM: Her avandia and metformin were held and she was continued on her
NPH and a sliding scale.
5. RENAL: Her Cr. was 1.4 at admission and improved to 1.1 with diuresis.
She was given mucomyst for renal protection.
6. FEN: She was maintained on a 2L fluid restriction and 2g Na
restriction.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Call your doctor if you have any more shortness of breath or
difficulty doing your daily activities.
2. Resume your usual home dose of lasix , monitor your weight daily and
call your doctor if your weight is increasing. Eat a diet low in salt
( less than 2 grams ).
3. We have decreased the dose of your atenolol to 50mg daily ( 1 pill ).
4. Please have your PCP Dr. Nickless check your creatinine on Friday November This has been arranged and her office will contact you.
5. Please call Dr. Lychwala for a follow up appointment.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Please follow patient's Cr. She received contrast for a CT.
2. Please adjust BP meds. Her atenolol dose was decreased because her
heart rate was in the 40s.
3. Please evaluate her anemia. Her Hct was in the low 30s while in the
hospital.
