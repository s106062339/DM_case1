*************************Hospital Course********************
1.CV ISCH: Elevated ck , tni ( - ) , ckmb low , ruled out X3 cont.
Beta Blocker , ASA , non-occlusive 2vd on cath.
PUMP: warm and wet; the patient was diresed approximately 6 Liters to
her dry weight of 149 kilograms. At dry weight patient had a BNP
of 3700. In house her ACE was switched to Cozaar secondary to cough.
Beta Blocker was changed to once a day Atenolol. An echo on 8/28
revealed EF 21% mV moderate mr , incomplete closure , TV: moderate tr ,
incomplete closure;LV globak HK , rv mildly to moderately decreased ,
incomplete study due to patient not fully cooperating. On the patients
final day in the hospital she was noted to have symptomatic dehydra
tion and was orthostatic - symptoms resoved with a 500 cc NS bolus.
2.ENDO : the patient's insulin regiment was modified and she was dc'd
on insulin 70/30 10 am. THe patient's admission regimine of Lantus 40 q
d was causing both hyper and hypoglycemia in house. Her hospital course
was notable for a few episodes of hypoglycemia resulting in down
titration of insulin AM and PM doses. THe patient was noted to be
extremely hypoglycmeic on 8 units of 70/30 in the PM and the PM
insulin was discontinued for the time being. It was decided that the
patient's diet at home would have higher glucose and carbohydrate
content and her Fs's will need further w/up as outpatient. We reccomend
titrating the 70/30 insulin up as needed.
3.GI: she complained of mild epigastric pain after meals , and said it
is thought that this represents diabetic gastroparesis. Her reglan
dose was increased to 10 and she tolerated PO's better subsequently and
was less symptomatic.
4.HEME: cont coumadin
5.PROPHYLAXIS: coumadin , nexium
