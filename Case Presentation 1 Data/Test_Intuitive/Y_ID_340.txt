DEATH SUMMARY: The patient was a 69-year-old female with a
history of coronary disease status post prior myocardial
infarction and surgery in 2002 who presented to R.healt Medical Center Emergency Department on 5/10/05 with three days
of chest pain and shortness of breath. Of note she had been
noncompliant with prior regimens and treatments and despite
diuretics started three days by her primary care physician she
reported new shortness of breath and chest pain at rest. An EKG
in the emergency department revealed widespread ST depressions.
She was treated for pulmonary edema with IV nitroglycerin , Lasix ,
aspirin , heparin , beta-blockers , and then she was taken urgently
to the cath lab where coronary angiography revealed a left main
coronary artery thrombosis with proximal and distal stenoses of
about 70% , 50% of her LAD , and 60% of her first diagonal. The
patient was transferred to the coronary care unit after placement
of an intraaortic balloon pump for further management and
evaluation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
CHF , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , CAD , prior myocardial
infarction , restrictive lung disease , diabetes mellitus , chronic
renal insufficiency , morbid obesity , and iron deficiency anemia.
HOME MEDICATIONS:

Toprol , lisinopril , albuterol , and famotidine.
ALLERGIES:
She was allergic to erythromycin , Bactrim , and IV contrast.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Noncontributory.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Noted no fever , chills , sweats , coughs , abdominal pain , nausea ,
or vomiting.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
She was morbidly obese with moderate respiratory distress lying
at about 30-degree angle. Her O2 saturation was 97% on 3L nasal
cannula. Temperature was 99 degrees , pulse was 80 and regular ,
BP was 140/50 , and respirations about 20. Mucous membranes were
moist and intact. Pupils were equal , round , and reactive to
light. Her sclerae were anicteric. Her conjunctivae were pale.
She had a 15-cm of JVD with 2+ carotids without bruits. Coarse
breath sounds bilaterally with crackles two-thirds of the way up
the bases. Cardiac exam was regular rate and rhythm with 2/6
holosystolic murmur. Her abdomen was obese , soft , nontender , and
nondistended. She had no clubbing , cyanosis , or palpable edema.
She has 1+ distal pulses noted.
Her EKG was normal sinus rhythm with ST depressions in the
inferolateral leads and a right bundle-branch block was present.
Her chest x-ray revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates
consistent with edema. So the patient was admitted to the
coronary care unit and a consult with Cardiovascular Surgery and
serial crits were performed. The patient's condition continued
to deteriorate. She developed respiratory distress. Anesthesia
was called and her airway was secured via an emergent intubation.
The patient subsequently developed signs of abdominal pain and
presumed sepsis and ischemic bowel. She was brought to the
operating room for an exploratory laparotomy. Status post an
exploratory laparotomy the patient had a complex course in the
surgical ICU where she underwent multi-organ system dysfunction.
Her prognosis was very dire. This was explained to the family
and on 7/12/05 at 2:20 a.m. the family decided to withdraw care ,
which will be consistent with both the patient and family's
wishes and desires , and the patient was pronounced dead at 2:24
