BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: syncope
HPI: 58M with ESRD
s/p renal allograft complicated by cellular rejection on HD MWF ,
DMII , HTN , aortic stenosis s/p AVR ( porcine ) with simultaneous single
vessel CABG LIMA->LAD. Pt reports eating breakfast and taking morning
medications and then feeling lightheaded , diaphoretic , with his heart
racing. His symptoms began while he was sitting , but he stood up to
walk across the room and felt his symptoms worsen. He
remembers feeling more "dizzy" and "unsteady" and then remembers
being on the ground. He does not remember falling or lowering
himself , but he denies loss of consciousness. EMS was called to take
him to the
ED. On the ambulance he felt some substernal heaviness
and discomfort that lasted less than 1 hours. The feeling resolved
after receiving oxygen. He denies chest pain prior to fainting.
He has not felt well since his renal transplant complaining of
shortness of breath. He however notes increasing shortness of breath ,
cough , and fatigue over the past weeks. Denies fever , chills ,
edema , melena , bright red blood per rectum , hematochezia , dysuria ,
hematuria. He did feel nauseas after he
fainted.
In ED seen by renal fellow and sent to dialysis where he received 2
units PRBC for Hct of 24.

Consults: GI Dohn , Marlin 16288 , Renal is primary team.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Impression:
58M with ESRD s/p renal allograft rejection here for syncope , likely
symptomatic anemia. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Plan: Renal - by history sounds volume overloaded will
likely need more frequent dialysis to remove excess fluid.
Nephrocaps.On steroid taper for rejection.
CV-I: nonobstructive CAD s/p LIMA to LAD , pt has been on ASA in past ,
unclear why stopped will consider adding asa after consultation with
PCP. Will ROMI with enzymes as pt admitted for
sycope.given NSVT may need ischemic eval. CV-P: volume up by symptoms
and xray , will need more frequent dialysis , will consider repeating
echo as part of the evalution for syncope - specifically to evaluate
aortic prosthesis function. Echo
OK. CV-R: monitor on tele , BB for
VT Heme: Pt anemia with Hct of 24 , on high doses of
Epo and IV iron at HD , this suggests blood loss. Will guiaic stools ,
monitor hct , renal ultrasound today to evaluate for hemorrhage into
allograft. Received 2 units PRBC at HD.GI consulted and
planning EGD on Monday. Pulm: chronic cough likely secondary to
cigarette smoking , recent worsening likely represents
pulmonary edema , will monitor respiratory status. ID: WBC 12 , with no
evidence of infection , monitor fever curve and culture if
spikes. Endo: DM on vague sliding scale at home , Will start
with NPH 10 BID , Regular 4 AC with sliding scale for additional
coverage and titrate to requirements.
GI: guiac + stools. EGD uremarkable here. Nexium for
gerd. GU: cystoscopy as outpt , urine cytology , for
intermittent hematuria. PPX: Nexium , Hep SC
