HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 5/30/05 and taken
to the operating room where he underwent a heart transplant and
excision of HeartMate LVAD without complication. For further
details , please see the dictated operative note. The patient was
on bypass for 200 minutes with cross clamp time of 77 minutes.
He left the operating room with one atrial wire , one ventricular
wire , three pair of cardio tubes ( Blake drains ) , and two right
pleural tubes ( Blake drains ). AICD was excised from left
clavicular space and a Blake drain was left in the pacer pocket.
The patient was admitted to the Tiesdea Rellla Memorial Hospital ICU on discharge from
the operating room. The patient was extubated on the evening of
postop day 0 without complications. He was brought up on
epinephrine , milrinone , dopamine , vasopressin , insulin , and
propofol drips.
ICU COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Neuro: The patient was extubated early on postop day 1 and
propofol was turned off on arrival to the ICU. The patient was
given Dilaudid IV initially for pain , converted to p.o. Dilaudid.
He was also started on Zoloft on postop day 2 at 75 mg p.o.
daily for his anxiety. He is relatively anxious but his pain has
been well controlled with Dilaudid. He will leave the ICU on
Dilaudid p.o. p.r.n. pain.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient was brought up from the
operating room on epinephrine , milrinone , dopamine , and
vasopressin drips. All drips were continued from postop day 1 to
postop day 2. The patient's cardiac output and index were stable
and his next venous saturations were stable in the 70s on this
combination. Epinephrine was weaned slowly from postop days 2-3.
It was off by postop day 4. Dopamine and vasopressin were also
weaned from postop day 4-5. Hemodynamics remained stable.
Milrinone was decreased to 0.4 from 0.5 on postop day 6. The
patient will leave the ICU on postop day 6 and milrinone per Dr.
Kridler will be weaned at 0.1 per day. The patient has been
hemodynamically stable from a cardiovascular standpoint since
arrival from the operating room. He was started on aspirin 81
daily. Swan was removed prior to discharge from the intensive
care unit on postop day 5 , 11/4/05 .
3. Pulmonary: The patient was extubated early on postop day 1
without complications. The patient remained very wet secondary
to the amount of fluid and products he received in the operating
room. The patient was started on a Lasix drip on postop day 1 ,
which was continued for a goal urine output of 200 to 300 cc an
hours. Patient with negative 3-4 liters in 24 hours over the
postop days 2-5. Lasix was discontinued on postop day 5 prior to
transfer from the ICU as patient had been diuresing a large
amount and creatinine had risen slightly up to 2.1 from 1.5
preoperatively. Urine output will continue to be monitored with
a goal of negative overall fluid balance , as patient remains wet
on chest x-ray.
4. GI: The patient's diet was advanced as tolerated. He is
currently eating a regular low-fat , low-cholesterol diet and is
on Nexium. He also remains on vitamins , folate , Colace , and
lactulose. He has still not had a bowel movement prior to
discharge from the intensive care unit.
5. Renal: The patient was aggressively diuresed beginning on
postop day 1 with a Lasix drip. The Lasix drip was adjusted for
a goal urine output of 200 to 300 cc an hour for several days.
Drip was turned off on postop day 4 for a short period and again
on postop day 5 as urine output remained stable at greater than
200 an hour. Lasix drip is off on postop day 5 prior to transfer
from the intensive care unit. The patient will continue to need
diuresis since he is still wet on chest x-ray. The patient's
creatine has bumped , however , from 1.5 to 2.1 at this point.
6. Endocrine: The patient was weaned from his insulin drip on
postop day 5. He was continued on the Portland protocol during
his time in the ICU as sugars were greater than 150. The patient
was started on postop day 2 on prednisone 35 p.o. b.i.d. , Neoral
75 mg p.o. b.i.d. , which was since increased to 100. At the time
of discharge , patient remained on prednisone 35 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
Neoral 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and CellCept 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d. per
the transplant team. Cyclosporin levels were followed and doses
were adjusted as needed.
7. Heme: The patient was started on aspirin beginning on postop
day 1. Aspirin is 81 mg p.o. daily.
8. ID: The patient received vancomycin for his chest tube
prophylaxis. Chest tubes removed on 7/18/05 , postop day 4.
Vanco was discontinued after this. Bactrim was also started on
postop day 1 for PCP prophylaxis and Valcyte was started several
