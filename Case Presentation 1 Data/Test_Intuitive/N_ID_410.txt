BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: weakness , chest pain
***
HPI: Mr Bickford is a 65 year old with a past medical history of
hypertension , cocaine/EtOH abuse , rheumatic heart disease with AI/MR , who
presents with chest pain from rehab 12 hours after discharge from 9 day
admission. His chest pain is identical to prior episodes occurring during
his previous admission. He originally presented with 2-3 weeks of
generalized weakness with intermittent chest pain and was diagnosed with
severe polymyositis ( CK up to 33 , 000 ) during last admission. He was given
IVF+bicarb for renal protection from myoglobinuria and became volume
overloaded , with successful diuresis to euvolemia by the time of
discharge. He had intermittent CP occurring at night , described as
nonradiating over left chest associated with SOB. He had persistently
elevated troponin with no ischemic changes on EKG , and his CP was felt to
be due to myocarditis. He was treated with ASA , labetalol , isordil ,
CCB , and ativan with improvement. He was started on IV solumedrol
with immediate significant improvement in CK ( down to 10 , 000 ) and
troponin ( 0.64 ). During his 12 hour stay at rehab , he developed CP
with SOB occurring at night. He was then readmitted to TH for cardiac
catheterization and further care.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Chest pain and shortness of breath. He was re-admitted for nocturnal
chest pain while at rehab , and concern for myocardial ischemia. He
underwent cardiac catheterization that showed normal coronary anatomy ,
suggesting that the elevated CK-MB and troponin were likely from
myocarditis , as previously suspected. Notably , his chest pain was often
associated with shortness of breath. It was noted on his prior admission
that he had pleural effusions from the high volume diuresis intended to
protect his kidneys from myoglobin toxicity , however he had been diuresing
well to lasix. It was thought that his CP and SOB might be due to PND given
his valvular disease. Consequently , his vasoldilatory medications were
switched to evening dosing , his lasix dose increased , and the head of bed
kept elevated at greater than thirty degrees. On the day after admission , he
had one episode of chest pain with shortness of breath , where he indicated
pain in his RUQ. A KUB was negative , as was a PE protocol CT , and he
responded very well to lasix. He had one further episode of SOB at night ,
again responsive to lasix and position. He had a repeat echo that showed
no progression of his valvular disease from prior admission and equivalent
EF of 70-75%. He was maintained on aspirin , labetalol , diltiazem , imdur , and
ativan prn.
2. Arrhythmias. He was on rate control with calcium channel blockers.
He had several noctural few beat runs of NSVT , but no other significant
events.
3. Rhabdo: He has severe polymyositis causing muscle weakness and elevated
CK , with possible contribution from cocaine. So far , the remaining work up
has been negative. Preliminary biopx sy shows muscle necrosis and
chronic inflammation along with features reminiscent of dermatomyositis. He
was changed back to IV solumedrol on admission , and switched to PO solumedrol
on discharge. His CK dropped from 15 , 000 on this admission to 10 , 000 , and
then hovered around that dose. Rheumatology Consult Fellow Gavin Nordman felt
this was a normal pattern under treatment , and that the true extent of
recovery/impairment will only be known in several weeks to months.
diagnosis.
4. Renal. His Cr was maintained at 1.3-1.5 over the course of his admission ,
likely related to both renal damage from myoglobinuria and possibly from
over-diureses and pre-renal phsyiology , especially in the context of BUN of
42. His lasix dose , initially increased on admission due to excellent
symptomatic response with diuresis , was in the process of slow tapering at
the time of discharge in attempt to identify the appropriate outpatient
dosing , with goal of maximizing symptomatic resopnse and minimizing prerenal
physiology.
5. FULL CODE
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Mr Water You were admitted for chest pain , and it was determined by
looking at the anatomy of the vessels supplying your heart that you have
not had a heart attack caused by diminished blood flow to the heart. You
do , however , have an inflammatory condition in which your immune system
attacks and breaks down your muscle. As you know , the recovery process
will be long , and you will need to take medication for it for at least
four to eight weeks. Your rheumatologist , Dr Zoelle , will coordinate your
medication and care. You have an appointment with her in two weeks.
Also , you have disease afflicting the valves of your heart , and you will
need to see a cardiologist. You have an appointment with Dr Kissi for this
issue. In addition , you have an appointment with your new primary care
physician , Dr Holverson . Please attend all of these appointments , and be
sure to take all your medications as prescribed. Lastly , it cannot be
emphasized enough that your health depends on the care you take of
yourself , making sure to stop smoking , stop drinking alcohol , and stop
taking any illicit drugs.
Please seek medical attention for difficulty breathing , worsening
weakness , black or bloody stools , or any other concerns.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Myositis. Please follow CK , may need additional agent in the long term.
Per Rheumatology , response may take weeks.
2. Chest pain. His pain is NOT of ischemic origin. He does have rheumatic
heart disease , and appears to have PND with pain and shortness of breath
that is responsive to lasix , position , and oxygen.
3. Lasix dosing. He will need to be tapered on lasix , with attempt to
identify the proper dose for symptomatic relief while not making him
pre-renal.
