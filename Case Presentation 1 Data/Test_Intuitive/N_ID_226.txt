Discharge Date: 6/25/1998
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
OTHER SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: 1 ) HYPOTHYROIDISM.
2 ) ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
3 ) HYPERTENSION.
4 ) HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 68 year-old woman
with a history of myocardial
infarction , atrial fibrillation , hypertension and congestive heart
failure who presents with shortness of breath.
The patient is status post inferior posterior myocardial infarction
on March , 1998. Thrombolysis was deferred secondary to severe
hypertension ( systolic blood pressure was greater than 200 ).
Catheterization revealed 80% RCA stenosis with thrombus. She
underwent PTCA and stenting and ReoPro under the Lakeni Ralton Rooson Hospital study.
An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 45% , inferior
posterior lateral hypokinesis , 2+ tricuspid regurgitation , 2+
mitral regurgitation , moderate aortic insufficiency. She was
treated with Ticlid for 30 days , aspirin , Lopressor , Verapamil and
Captopril. That hospital course was complicated by asymptomatic
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the setting of pneumonia and new
diagnosis of hyperthyroidism ( TSH less than assay , T4 16.1 , T3 133 ,
THBR 1.24 ). She was started on Procainamide and subsequently as an
outpatient on PTU without recurrence of atrial fibrillation. She
has been treated with Coumadin. On April , 1998 , she was admitted
for left upper extremity weakness with a question of transient
ischemic attack in the setting of subtherapeutic INR. Head CT scan
was negative and brain MRI/MRA was also negative. On September ,
1998 , she was admitted to Hillh Hospital for flash pulmonary
edema requiring intubation. She was in normal sinus rhythm , but
hypertensive. She ruled out for myocardial infarction and repeat
catheterization showed patent stent , otherwise unchanged. She was
subsequently started on Lasix and was well until the night prior to
admission when she developed gradually worsening shortness of
breath , wheezing and chest pain. Also , she had an increase in
orthopnea from one to two pillows , diaphoresis and worsening of her
baseline right shoulder pain with no edema. She had a cough
productive of scant white sputum for three days prior to admission ,
no fever or chills. In the emergency room , her blood pressure was
found to be 230/100 with an oxygen saturation of 91% on room air
increasing to 95% on two liters. She had crackles one-third of the
way up her lung fields bilaterally. EKG was in normal sinus
rhythm. Chest x-ray showed edema and effusion. She improved
quickly with oxygen , nitrates and Lasix.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease ,
status post myocardial infarction in
October of 1998 , congestive heart failure with an ejection
fraction of 45% , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation , hyperthyroidism , bilateral retinal detachment , status
post left cataract surgery , status post appendectomy , status post
cholecystectomy.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q. day. 2 )
Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q. day. 3 )
Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day. 4 ) Coumadin 2 mg p.o. q. day. 5 )
Procainamide 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. 6 ) Simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q. day.
7 ) PTU 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. 8 ) Lasix 10 mg p.o. q. day. 9 )
Prilosec.
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She immigrated from the Pa Drive , Meroesun Geworth in
1981. She lives with her daughter and has a two
pack per day smoking history times 40 years. She has no alcohol
use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , she was breathing
comfortably , supine at 30 degrees. Vital
signs: Temperature 98.4 degrees , heart rate 61 and regular , blood
pressure 153/75 , respiratory rate 18 , with an oxygen saturation 93%
on three liters. HEENT examination revealed that the sclerae were
anicteric. Pupils were equal , round and reactive to light.
Extraocular movements were intact. Oropharynx was benign. Neck
revealed that the jugular venous pressure was elevated to her ear.
Carotids were 1+ on the right , 2+ on the left. There was a
question of a right carotid bruit. There was no thyromegaly.
Lungs revealed crackles half way up bilaterally , no wheezing.
Cardiac examination was regular rate and rhythm with an S4 ,
intermittent S3 , no murmurs. Abdomen revealed normal active bowel
sounds , soft and non-tender , mildly distended with a pulsatile
liver. Extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema. There
were 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. There was no calf
tenderness. Skin was warm and dry. Neurological examination
revealed that cranial nerves III-XII were intact. Motor was five
out of five throughout. Sensory was intact to light touch
throughout. Reflexes were 2+ bilaterally with downgoing toes.
Rectal examination was guaiac negative in the emergency room.
LABORATORY: Admission laboratory studies revealed a sodium of 140 ,
potassium 4.4 , chloride 105 , bicarbonate 26 , BUN 19 ,
creatinine 0.6 , glucose 149. White blood cell count was 12.3 ,
hematocrit 38.8 , platelet count was normal. CK was 44. Troponin
was 0.03. INR was 1.8. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 90 with
old inferior Qs , left ventricular hypertrophy with strain in I and
L which were old , T-wave inversion in III and V6 as well as
pseudonormalized T-waves in V1 through V4 which are new compared
with October , 1998. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly , pulmonary
vascular redistribution , Kerley B lines , but no infiltrate.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Congestive heart failure: The assessment was
that the patient presented in acute congestive
heart failure , most likely due to diastolic dysfunction in the
setting of hypertension. Other contributing factors possibly
playing a role in the patient's heart failure could have included
medication non-compliance and dietary indiscretion. Another
possibility entertained was that the patient could have had
transient atrial fibrillation triggering heart failure , however all
of her EKGs showed her to be normal sinus rhythm , questioning this
possibility. The patient was diuresed with intravenous Lasix and
stabilized on p.o. Lasix during her hospital course.
She ruled out for myocardial infarction by CKs , Troponin and EKG.
2 ) Hyperthyroidism: The patient's TSA was measured to be at less
than assay on May , 1998 raising the possibility that uncontrolled
hyperthyroidism could also be contributing to her cardiac
dysfunction. An Endocrine consult was obtained with the
recommendation that her PTU be increased to 100 mg t.i.d. Her T4
and THBR were measured and found to be 8.1 and 0.91 which were
within normal limits after the increased dose of PTU. The patient
is to receive follow-up in the Thyroid Clinic for definitive
therapy , possibly iodine ablation of known thyroid nodules in her
left lobe.
3 ) Elevated white blood cell count on admission , but with a normal
differential: The patient remained afebrile throughout her
hospital course. Urinalysis was negative for infection and repeat
chest x-ray showed no infiltrate.
4 ) Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remained in the
range of 110-155/50-70s during her hospital course on Atenolol ,
Isordil and Lisinopril.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1 ) Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day. 2 )
Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q. day. 3 ) Lasix
80 mg p.o. q. day. 4 ) Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. 5 ) Lisinopril
40 mg p.o. q. day. 6 ) Procainamide SR 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. 7 ) PTU
100 mg p.o. t.i.d. 8 ) Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q. day.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged in stable
condition.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home with VNA services
to check weights and assistance with medication.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to follow-up with Dr. Pastor on February ,
1998 and Dr. Rais in the Thyroid Clinic on August ,
1998.
