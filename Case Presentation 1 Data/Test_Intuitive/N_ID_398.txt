Discharge Date: 3/13/1996
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: UNSTABLE ANGINA.
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS:
1. HYPERTENSION.
2. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
3. NON-INSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS , DIET CONTROLLED.
4. NASAL POLYPS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Ulses is a 74-year-old man
with a history of coronary artery
disease status post a myocardial infarction in September 1995. At that
time , he had a peak CK of 6 , 700 and an MB fraction of 199. His
infarction was treated with TPA at Netla Ainor Center .  In January
1995 , he was admitted to Cerri Medical Center with
substernal chest pain. A catheterization , at that time , showed
100% left circumflex. He had an angioplasty to 20% residual , which
was complicated by a small dissection. He had an LV gram with
inferior hypokinesis , and he also had an 80% OM1 lesion that was
angioplastied to 30% residual. His ejection fraction was 53%. He
has been subsequently followed as an outpatient without recurrence
of his anginal symptoms. Approximately six weeks prior to
admission , his Vasotec was changed to Cozaar and his Niacin was
changed to Pravachol. At that time , he began having some
intermittent substernal chest pain , both at rest and with exertion.
Two weeks prior to admission , he was admitted to an outside
hospital with a complaint of chest pain. He is without current
myocardial infarction. He had an exercise tolerance test and was
then discharged. The results of the exercise tolerance test were
not available at the time of admission here. There was a question
of an irregular heartbeat during his exercise and he stopped the
procedure secondary to fatigue. The patient stopped his own
Pravachol and he changed from Cozaar to Vasotec 10 mg q.day , at
that time. As mentioned above , the patient has had increased
frequency of substernal chest pain , both at rest and with exertion
over the last six weeks. At 2 a.m. on the day of admission , the
patient experienced a substernal chest pain as a dull ache without
radiation. He had no other associated symptoms. He does not
associate the pain with any particular level of exertion , that it
can happen sitting still or with activity without any particular
pattern. With today's episode , he had climbed two flights of
stairs and then developed this chest pain which lasted for 10-15
minutes. It was not relieved with rest or after one to two tabs of
sublingual nitroglycerin. By the time he arrived at the Emergency
Department , his chest pain was gone. In the Emergency Department ,
his systolic blood pressure was noted to be 230 and he was treated
with nifedipine times one and IV nitroglycerin which brought his
blood pressure down to 140/90 and he was admitted for evaluation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , as above.
Hypertension , non-insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus times five years , diet controlled , and nasal polyps.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Aspirin , Vasotec 5 mg p.o. q.day , atenolol
5 mg p.o. q.day.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin and Toprol.
FAMILY HISTORY: His father died of coronary artery disease at age
48. His mother died of congestive heart failure
at age 80.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He has been retired since his 60s. He is a former
warehouse owner and shipping business owner. He
occasionally will bicycle eight miles at a time or be able to walk
six miles at a time two to three times a work. He has not done
this since this summer.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He was in no acute distress , no chest pain.
His temperature was 97.1 , blood pressure
140/70 , pulse 68 , saturation 96% on room air , and respiratory rate
14. HEENT examination revealed extraocular muscles were intact.
Pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light and accommodation.
Oropharynx was clear. Neck revealed no JVD , no bruits. Lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiac examination was
bradycardic , normal S1 and S2 , no murmurs , rubs , or gallops.
Abdomen was soft , nontender , and nondistended with positive bowel
sounds , no organomegaly. Rectal examination was guaiac negative
per Emergency Department. Extremities had no cyanosis , clubbing ,
or edema. There were 2+ pulses , DP and PT. Neurological
examination revealed he was alert and oriented times three , grossly
nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: EKG revealed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 43
intervals 0.133 , 0.121 , 0.483 , axis 48 ,
interventricular conduction delay , and small ST depression in V4
and V5 of 0.5 mm. Chest x-ray revealed no edema , no infiltrate ,
question of opacity in the right upper lobe versus first rib.
Sodium was 141 , potassium 5.1 , chloride 106 , bicarbonate 25 , BUN
12 , creatinine 0.9 , alkaline phosphatase 81 , LDH 298 , troponin I 0 ,
and CK 96.
ASSESSMENT: The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of
coronary artery disease , status post myocardial
infarction and status post angioplasty of his left circumflex and
OM1 branches , admitted with unstable angina over the past six weeks
after a severe episode of chest pain the day prior to admission ,
causing orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He was
admitted for evaluation and for control of severe hypertension.
HOSPITAL COURSE: CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient's blood pressure was
controlled nicely initially on IV nitroglycerin. His Vasotec was
increased to 10 mg b.i.d. and then discontinued. He was weaned
down off of the IV nitroglycerin and started on Imdur 60 mg p.o.
b.i.d. and was also started on losartan , which was tapered up to 75
mg p.o. q.day with improved control of his blood pressure. The
patient apparently had a poor reaction to Norvasc in the past , so
this medication was not tried.
On 1 of September September 1996 , he underwent cardiac catheterization which
showed a right atrial pressure of 6 , right ventricular pressure
36/8 , pulmonary artery pressure 40/16 , mean of 23 , pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure mean of 11 , left ventricular pressure
195/36 , cardiac output 5.3 , and cardiac index 2.5. He had a 70%
LAD lesion and a 50% first diagonal branch lesion. Circumflex was
okay and he had 40% and 25% serial RCA lesions. A 3.0 micron stent
was placed in the proximal LAD down to a residual of 25%. He was
started on Ticlid and continued on heparin for 48 hours.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day , atenolol 50 mg
p.o. q.day , nitroglycerin sublingual q.5
minutes p.r.n. , Imdur 60 mg p.o. q.day , losartan 75 mg p.o. q.day ,
and Ticlid 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. to be taken for one month.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow up with Dr. Eisentrout next week.
