ALLERGIES: Penicillin and sulfa.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies tobacco , alcohol , or IV drug
use. She has two children and lives alone since hospitalization.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 99.2 , pulse 89 ,
blood pressure 130/86 , respiratory rate 20 , and oxygen saturation
100% on room air. General , the patient is in no acute distress ,
but is unable to talk with the trach tube currently in place.
HEENT , mucous membranes are moist and there are no OP lesions.
Neck , JVP is not appreciated due to the patient's body habitus.
Cardiovascular , heart rate is regular , regular rhythm , no
murmurs , gallops , or rubs. Chest , decreased breath sounds in all
fields with a prolonged expiratory phase. Abdomen , bowel sounds
are present , abdomen is obese , nontender , and there is a G tube
in place. Extremities , no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema.
Extremities are obese. Skin , no rashes or bruises. Neurologic ,
no cranial nerve , sensory , or motor deficits noted. Gait is
deferred.
LABORATORY FINDINGS ON ADMISSION: The patient's CBC reveals a
hematocrit of 29.2 , which is consistent with her baseline of 28
to 30. Her CBC , chem-7 , and LFTs are all unremarkable.
PROCEDURES:
1. Trach tube change - the patient's tracheostomy tube was
changed to a Custom #6 Bivona on 10/21/05 by Dr. Klatt ( Surgery ).
2. Bronchoscopy - A bronchoscopy was performed on 5/28/05 and
revealed erythematous soft tissue in the posterior pharynx ,
compromising the airway above the trach tube. Granulation tissue
was noted above the site of the trach tube that also appeared to
potentially compromise the airway.
3. Modified barium swallow - modified barium swallow was
performed on 10/21/05 , which revealed a moderate aspiration risk.
The patient was recommended for a mechanical soft diet.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Trach change: On admission , the patient was admitted to the
General Medical Service for problems with her trach tube. Over
the course of this admission , her trach tube did become dislodged
on numerous occasions. During these times , either surgery or
respiratory therapy were required to reinsert the trach tube.
However , the patient remained stable throughout these events with
a pulse oximetry reading greater than 92% , even when the
tube became dislodged. The patient required a Custom fit #6
Bivona cuffless trach tube. Dr. Avellano ( General Surgery ) inserted this tube
without incident. Initially , the patient did feel some irritation once the
tube was inserted , however , this resolved with deep suctioning and nebulizer
therapy. Once inserted , the new trach tube fit well and the
patient was comfortable , with oxygen saturations greater than 92%
on trach mask oxygen.
2. Redundant oropharyngeal tissue: During this admission , the
patient underwent a bronchoscopy to evaluate for possibile
decannulation. However , this procedure revealed
excessive tissue in her upper oropharynx and
what appeared to be edematous tissue in the airway. The significance of this
finding was uncertain , although it was felt that this tissue could
compromise the airway if her trach tube was removed. Therefore ,
the patient should not be decannulated without repeat evaluation of her
upper airway. Throughout this hospital
course , the patient had her trach tube in place. She was able to
use a Passey-Muir valve for speaking and she may continue to use
one with her trach tube in place.
3. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's history of
recurrent pneumonia and poor pulmonary function , the patient
underwent a modified barium swallow evaluation for possible
aspiration pneumonia. She was found to have some difficulty
during this evaluation , and Speech and Swallow recommended the
patient continue a mechanical soft diet without fluid
restrictions indefinitely. During this hospital course , the
patient had been on tube feeds through her G tube , although these
may be tapered once the patient is tolerating oral food well.
COMPLICATIONS: None.
CONSULTANTS: Dr. August Adkinson , General Surgery.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE: On discharge , the patient's
temperature was 97.8 , pulse 81 , blood pressure 122/84 ,
respiratory rate 22 , and oxygen saturation 100% on supplemental
oxygen of 30% by trach mask. General , no acute distress ,
pleasant , obese woman. HEENT , mucous membranes are moist.
Pupils are round. Extraocular movements are intact. Neck , JVP
could not be assessed. Chest , distant breath sounds with
occasional wheezes , but no appreciable crackles or rhonchi.
Cardiovascular , S1 and S2 intact , regular , but distant heart
sounds. Abdomen is obese , soft , and nontender , positive bowel
sounds , without appreciable masses. Extremities are obese , but
without edema.
