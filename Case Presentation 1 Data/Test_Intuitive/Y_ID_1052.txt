Discharge Date: 11/26/1995
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. CHEST PAIN , FOR RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL
INFARCTION
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 2. INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES
3. CHRONIC ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
4. HYPERTENSION
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60 year old , Spanish
speaking woman with multiple cardiac
risk factors who presented complaining of unstable chest pain. The
patient's cardiac risk factors include adult onset diabetes ,
hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , a positive family history ,
previous history of smoking as well as postmenopausal state
secondary to hysterectomy 21 years ago and not on estrogen
replacement therapy. The patient has a two to three year history
of exertional angina. Of note , approximately one year ago she
began to have substernal chest pain at rest. The patient states
that currently she is having approximately three episodes a day on
average. She describes these as substernal chest pressure which
radiates to her bilateral arms as well as her jaw. She denies any
associated shortness of breath but does occasionally note
diaphoresis. She denies any nausea or vomiting or palpitations.
In September of 1994 the patient underwent an echocardiogram which
showed a left atrial size of 4.0 cm and ejection fraction of
approximately 60% with mild left ventricular hypertrophy and mild
tricuspid regurgitation. Since this time she has been followed by
Dr. Maximo Bryum in C&O MEDICAL CENTER Clinic who initiated an antianginal regimen
which resulted in decreased frequency of her symptoms. Of note the
patient recently stopped taking Aspirin. Her symptoms then
recurred. On the 5 of February , 1995 the patient underwent a
Dobutamine MIBBE on which she went 6 minutes and 48 seconds
reaching a maximal heart rate of 154 , a blood pressure of 172/82.
The test showed 2 mm ST depressions diffusely. The MIBBE showed
moderate to severe reversible anterior and anteroseptal wall
ischemia. Of note , on the morning of admission the patient was
seen by her VNA. During her VNA's visit the patient began to have
her typical anginal symptoms with radiation to her arms and jaw as
well as shortness of breath. She denied any diaphoresis or nausea.
The patient was given three sublingual Nitroglycerins after her
primary M.D. was called and her pain resolved after approximately
15 minutes. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for a 10 year
history of Insulin dependent diabetes with complications including
neuropathy and retinopathy. Chronic atrial fibrillation included a
normal TSH. Hypertension. Degenerative joint disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux. Status post hysterectomy approximately 21
years ago. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Enteric Coated Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
which the patient recently stopped , Coumadin 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. ,
Diltiazem 240 mg p.o. q.d. , Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopipd 600
mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Insulin , NPH , 75 units sub-q
q.a.m. , 50 units q.p.m. , Insulin Regular 25 units sub-q q.a.m.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her heart rate was 58 , blood pressure
141/73 , O-2 saturation 97% on 2 liters ,
respiratory rate 16 and unlabored. HEENT exam showed pupils equal
round and reactive to light. Extraocular movements were intact.
Oropharynx was clear. Mucous membranes were moist. Neck was
supple with full range of motion. Jugular venous pressure was
difficult to assess secondary to increased soft tissue around the
neck. Carotids were 2+ and without bruits. Cardiac exam showed an
irregularly irregular rate and rhythm , a normal S-1 and S-2 , a I/VI
systolic ejection murmur noted at the left upper sternal border.
Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion. Abdomen was soft ,
nontender , obese with active bowel sounds. Extremities showed a
right shin scar which was healing well. There was no clubbing or
cyanosis , no evidence of any femoral bruits. Rectal examination
was guaiac negative. On neurologic examination the patient was
alert and oriented x 2. Cranial nerves II-XII were intact.
Strength was 5/5 bilaterally. There was decreased sensation to
light touch bilaterally in the lower extremities.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission Sodium 134 , Potassium 4.7 , Chloride
96 , Bicarb 22 , BUN 28 , Creatinine 1.3 , Blood
Glucose 472 , Digoxin level 1.0. PT 14.5 , PTT 26. Urinalysis was
negative. EKG showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 60 with a
normal axis. T wave inversions were noted in both leads 3 and F
and Q waves were noted in V-1 through V-3. Chest x-ray showed no
evidence of infiltrates or effusions. There was borderline
cardiomegaly.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to Medicine Team Voone Parkway , Ainggo Ra I , Alaska 89772
She was ruled out for myocardial infarction with
serial CK , MB and EKG's. Heparin was initially started given the
possibility that this was unstable angina. The Cardiology Team was
consulted for recommendations on possible cardiac catheterization.
On further review of her history the Cardiology Team decided to
schedule a cardiac catheterization. This was performed on the 7 of October and showed mildly elevated right sided pressure including a
right atrial pressure of 15 , an RV pressure of 50/16 with a mean PA
pressure of 32 , pulmonary capillary wedge of 22. The coronary
arteries were noted to be normal and left ventricular function was
also assessed as normal. The patient tolerated this procedure well
and without complications. Given the confluence of her data , two
possible explanations were postulated including either syndrome X
or small vessel disease , not noted on cardiac catheterization. The
patient remained stable , status post cardiac catheterization and
was prepared for discharge. Also during her hospital course the
patient's Insulin dosages were adjusted in the manner to keep her
blood sugars in the approximately 200 range.
