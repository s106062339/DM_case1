BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. Codde is a 56 yo malel with a h/o IDDM , peripheral vascular disease ,
CAD , hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , s/p BKA on L who tripped over
rolled carpet at home/garage , fell and broke R femur/neck. He was
transferred here from an outside hospital on 5/4/06. Medicine ,
cardiology , and endocrinology was consulted for preoperative optimization
of care and risk stratification. He was taken the OR on 1/8/06 by Dr.
Summerhill for R hip pinning. See full operative note for details. He
tolerated the procedure well. Postoperatively , he did well also. His
postoperative course was notable for pulmonary edema which responded very
well to diuresis. He went from 100% face mask on POD 1 to RA within 2
days with monitored diuresis and electrolyte replacement. He had no
cardiac symptoms and remained hemodynamically stable. Endocrinology
followed him and made recommendations daily for adjustment of his insulin
regimen. They also recommended continuing his caltrate + vitamin D. He
also had some emesis postop which did not respond to zofran but did to
phenergan. Today he tolerated lunch well and by dinner , wife and patient
feel comfortable and in fact prefer to go home today. He is afebrile ,
vital signs within normal , 95% on RA. He has RRR , lungs CTAB. R hip
incision clean , dry , intact with staples. STrenght 5/5 RLE and sensation
intact. He has prosthesis on left LLE. He has been cleared by PT if
ambulance takes him home and he has 24hrs supervision which he has. He is
abulatory with walker and cane. He has special commode ordered. He will
return to see Dr. Perine in clinic in 2 weeks. He is being
discharged home with reglan and phenergan for nausea. He will have VNA and
