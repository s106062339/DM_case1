DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
ALBINISM.
HISTORY OF GOUT.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 46 year old Korean
male with a history of coronary artery
disease , who is status post coronary artery bypass grafting and
presented with severe left-sided chest pain radiating to the back
and arm occurring 7 hours previously. The patient's history of c
coronary artery disease began in 20 of June , when he developed substernal
chest pain and underwent cardiac catheterization showing a 100%
right coronary artery occlusion and 80% left anterior descending
occlusion , 70% proximal mid-left anterior descending lesion.
Angioplasty was attempted , but was unsuccessful. In 1 of January , the
patient underwent a 2-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr.
Melsheimer at Largdon Tar County Health with a left internal mammary
artery graft to the left anterior descending and right internal
mammary artery graft to the posterior descending artery. However ,
the patient had persistent incisional-type pain after his coronary
artery bypass grafting , but reported absence of his angina pain
post-CABG. The patient underwent an echocardiogram post-CABG
showing normal left ventricular function with no regional wall
motion abnormalities , moderate effusion and mild left atrial
enlargement 4.8 centimeters. The patient did well for 2 years
post-CABG and underwent an exercise tolerance test in 15 of September ,
exercising for 10 minutes and 0 seconds , maximum blood pressure
170/100 , without chest pain or electrocardiogram changes ,
considered to be a negative test. Since then , the patient has only
had sharp incisional pain not related to exertion , and he suffers
no exertional angina and has no exercise limitation. Over the past
several months , the patient has gradually developed increasing
exertional chest pain , increasing in both intensity and frequency ,
to the point where it was occurring daily 1 week prior to
admission. The patient had been tried on multiple medications as
an outpatient , however , because of issues of
noncompliance/alternative belief system , it was unclear as to what
medications the patient was actually taking. On the day of
admission at 1:30 pm , the patient experienced severe 8 out of 10
substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm with numbness and
neck tightness , associated with dizziness and numbness on the
scalp. The patient had no nausea , vomiting or shortness of breath ,
but did suffer pleuritic pain in addition. The pain lasted 30
minutes and was somewhat alleviated with rest and sitting in the
supine position on the way to the emergency room. At the Line Sumharca Center emergency room , the patient had worsening of
the severity of his pain and was treated with sublingual
nitroglycerin without relief , then morphine sulfate 4 milligrams
times 2 , Lopressor 5 milligrams times 1 , Nitro-Paste 1 inch with
complete relief. An electrocardiogram on admission showed normal
sinus rhythm , rate 80 , axis normal , no ST or T-wave abnormalities ,
no Q-waves. The patient was admitted to the Prorouge En No Team.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY was notable for albinism , he denies ulcers or
gastrointestinal bleeds , he has a history of gout. HABITS included
former heavy alcohol use , however , he denies use in the last 6
months. The patient smoked cigarettes until 5 years ago.
ALLERGIES were no known drug allergies. FAMILY HISTORY was
negative. SOCIAL HISTORY revealed the patient is an appliance
technician , he is married with 3 children. MEDICATIONS ON
ADMISSION revealed that the patient reported using Nifedipine-XL 30
milligrams by mouth each day , enteric-coated aspirin 1 per day ,
occasional Indocin and colchicine. His Inca Medical Center prescription also included Lisinopril 20 milligrams by mouth
per day , and Isordil 20 milligrams by mouth 3 times , but the
patient denied taking these.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was mildly diaphoretic in no
apparent distress. Temperature was 97 ,
heart rate 78 , blood pressure 140/90 , respiratory rate 20 on 2
liters of oxygen with 97% saturation. Skin was pale with red hair.
Oropharynx was clear , extraocular movements were intact , pupils
were equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation. Carotids
were II+ bilaterally , there was a sternotomy scar on the chest , no
evidence of infection. Lungs were clear to auscultation and
percussion without rales. Cardiac examination showed a soft S2 , S1
was normal , no murmurs , rubs or gallops. Abdomen was soft ,
nontender , no hepatosplenomegaly. Rectal examination showed normal
tone , normal prostate , guaiac negative. Femoral pulses were I+
bilaterally without bruits. Extremities showed II+ pulses in the
dorsalis pedis , no edema , the deep tendon reflexes were normal.
Neurologic examination was nonfocal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Chest x-ray showed clear lungs and no
pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
The electrocardiogram was as noted above. Sodium was 141 ,
potassium 4.7 , chloride 112 , bicarbonate 24 , blood urea nitrogen
26 , creatinine 1.8 , of note his baseline is 1.4 in 5-90 , glucose
85 , white blood cell count 3.59 , platelets 125 , 000 , hematocrit
44.5 , prothrombin time 12.7 , partial thromboplastin time 33.9 ,
creatinine kinase 1 , 010 with 20 myocardial bands , LDH 222.
Urinalysis was notable for 4+ proteinuria , no white cells , no red
cells , 1 to 2 hyaline casts.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The initial impression was the patient had
probable coronary disease and probable unstable
angina. He was admitted for intensive cardiac monitoring and
cardiac catheterization. The patient was started on heparin at
1 , 000 units per hour after bolus and sliding scale Nitro-Paste ,
aspirin and Lopressor , and continued on Nifedipine. On the first
day of admission , the patient suffered 2 episodes of substernal
chest pain and he was taken somewhat emergently to cardiac
catheterization which revealed a patent left internal mammary
artery graft to the left anterior descending , a patent right
internal mammary artery graft except for small vessel disease in
the graft , and an essentially occluded posterior descending artery.
The native coronary arteries showed occluded left anterior
descending proximally with filling from the left anterior
descending , circumflex showed a long 70% proximal lesion at the
second obtuse marginal branch with 90% distal lesion. The right
coronary artery was occluded proximally with right-to-right
collaterals and left-to-right collaterals from the left anterior
descending. The patient was planned for a 2-step angioplasty and
was returned to the floor for stabilization while awaiting his
angioplasty. However , the patient suffered 2 episodes of
substernal chest pain despite being on intravenous heparin and
intravenous nitroglycerin was initiated and the patient was
transferred to the Coronary Intensive Care Unit. The patient
remained pain-free until he underwent angioplasty of the right
coronary artery lesions with a result of 20% residual stenosis. Of
note , the patient's creatinine kinase levels continued to trend
downward with the initial creatinine kinase being 1 , 010 being his
maximal value. The patient had no further chest pain after his
angioplasty , except for the baseline incisional pain which was
unrelated to exertion. The patient was monitored closely for 2
days after angioplasty. Nitroglycerin was tapered off and the
patient was discharged on 9 of January Of note , the 4+ proteinuria
was unresolved at the time of discharge , because of his unstable
course and transfers between the Intensive Care Unit and the floor ,
we were unable to complete a 24-hour urine collection. This issue
will be addressed further.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to home. MEDICATIONS
ON DISCHARGE were aspirin 325 milligrams by mouth
each day , Lopressor 100 milligrams by mouth twice a day. CONDITION
ON DISCHARGE was stable. The patient will FOLLOW-UP with Dr. Jewel Fennel in the Tor'ssum Healthcare
Estimated disability is none.
