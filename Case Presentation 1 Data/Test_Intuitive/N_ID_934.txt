URINARY INCONTINENCE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Nittinger is a 70-year-old male
with hypertension , coronary artery
disease , non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , and a
75-pack-year history of tobacco use , who presented on 7/20 at the
Los Hospital with a four-day history of subjective fever
and nonproductive cough. The patient denied shortness of breath ,
chest pain , orthopnea , or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He
reported perfuse sweating , usually associated with fever , but
denied history of exposure to tuberculosis or history of
tuberculosis. The patient denied sick contacts and reported having
had an influenza vaccine during this past winter as well as having
a Pneumovax in the past. The patient also reported feeling
fatigued about one week prior to admission and , on the night of
admission , felt his legs collapse under him secondary to weakness.
He denied head trauma. He said he fell on his outstretched arm.
He has no history of seizure disorder and was fully conscious
throughout the event. He called his daughter who brought him to
the Collti Eshard Emergency Room. The patient was seen there and
evaluated , and he was transferred to the Napin Hospital in the early morning hours of 6/15/95 as he is a Pagham patient.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Angina ( none in the past several months ).
Coronary artery disease. Status post
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in 2/10 at which
time a 99% occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending was
noted , which was 30% after PTCA. Status post PTCA in 1/29 , again
with 99% occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending , which
was 30% after PTCA. Status post PTCA in 2/18 , again with 99%
occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending , which was 30%
after PTCA; there was a small complication in which a focal
dissection of the proximal left anterior descending was noted..
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Angioplasty as above.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Sublingual Nitroglycerin p.r.n. Lopressor
50 mg. p.o. b.i.d. Cardizem-SR 120 mg.
b.i.d. Coumadin 2.5 mg. alternating with 3 mg. p.o. q. day.
Lovastatin 20 mg. q. day. Glyburide 5 mg. q. day.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for cardiac disease. His father had lung
cancer.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He is married and lives with wife and daughter.
He has a 75-pack-year history of tobacco use. He
reportedly was smoking until two weeks prior to the onset of
illness. He denies any use of alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs at the Sno Valley Hospital Center
Emergency Room revealed temperature 102 ,
respiratory rate 16 , blood pressure 160/78. At the Delf11 Valley Medical Center Emergency Room , temperature was 100.7 , heart rate
96 , O2 saturations 95% on room air , blood pressure 128/80 ,
respiratory rate 20. This was a well-developed , well-nourished ,
white male who was somnolent but easily arousable. He was very
diaphoretic in the Emergency Room. Neck was supple with full range
of motion and no lymphadenopathy. The JVP was flat. Lungs
revealed anterior bronchial breath sounds in the left upper lung
field. Lungs were clear to auscultation posteriorly.
Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm with
occasional premature beats. An S1 and S2 were heard. There were
no no murmurs , gallops , or rubs. Abdomen was soft and nontender.
Bowel sounds were present. No masses or hepatosplenomegaly was
noted. On rectal exam , he had heme-negative , brown stool , and he
had a normal tone; this was per the Emergency Room staff.
Extremities revealed no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema. Neurologic
exam revealed cranial nerves III through XII were intact. He was
alert and oriented x three. Motor and sensory exam revealed 5/5
bilaterally. Reflexes were 0 to 1+ bilaterally and symmetrically.
Toes were downgoing. He had normal bulk and tone throughout.
X-RAY: Chest x-ray showed a left upper lobe infiltrate , and this
was per the Ontmang Hospital . A repeat chest x-ray
here on 5/25/95 again showed extensive left upper lobe pneumonia.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM: The electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus
rhythm at 89 with occasional premature
ventricular contractions. He had a Q-wave inversion in lead 3 and
AVF , biphasic V3.
LABORATORY DATA: Fluid balance panel revealed sodium 131 ,
potassium 3.4 , BUN and creatinine 23 and 1.4 ,
chloride and bicarb 98 and 23 , glucose 194. His LDH was elevated
slightly at 259. His other liver function tests were within normal
limits. His total protein was 5.7 , albumin 3.0. His hemoglobin
and hematocrit were 14.4 and 43.3 , respectively. White blood cell
count was 12 , 100 with a differential of 84% polys , 5% bands , 6%
lymphs , and 2% monos. Platelet count was 188 , 000. His urinalysis
was significant for white blood cells and red blood cells that were
too numerous to count. He had 3+ bacteria.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
PROBLEM #1: PNEUMONIA , LEFT UPPER LOBE. The patient received 1 g.
of Cefuroxime at the Sontro Cle Healthcare and was
transferred to the Termmette Medical Center where Cefotaxime
1 g. eight hours was begun. The patient continued to spike
temperatures on hospital days #1 and #2 , although blood and urine
cultures remained negative. On hospital day #3 , Erythromycin was
added to his antibiotic regimen as the patient continued to spike
temperatures. The following day , the patient defervesced and
remained afebrile throughout the hospital course. As mentioned
earlier , a repeat chest x-ray here again showed extensive left
upper lobe pneumonia. Clinically , the findings from the physical
exam showed a resolution of the bronchial breath sounds. On the
day of discharge , the patient's lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally. The patient had been afebrile for four days and had
been on Erythromycin orally for two days. The intravenous
Cefotaxime was also discontinued two days prior to discharge at
which point the intravenous Erythromycin was changed to orally at
500 mg. q.i.d. The patient was instructed that he should avoid the
use of tobacco as this would increase his likelihood of
redeveloping pneumonia as well as increase his likelihood of
worsening cardiac disease. A sputum sample was induced , and it was
sent for routine culture and AFB culture and smear. The cultures
were negative , and the AFB smear was negative for mycobacteria.
The cultures were negative on discharge.
PROBLEM #2: URINARY TRACT INFECTION. The patient was treated
with Cefotaxime which was also used for treatment of
his pneumonia. He was noted to have urinary incontinence , and by
report , the incontinence had begun approximately four or five days
prior to admission. It was felt that the incontinence might be
secondary to his ongoing infection. A repeat urinalysis was sent
approximately four days after admission and showed 1 to 2 white
blood cells and 0 bacteria. The patient , at that point , no longer
was having urinary incontinence; however , he was noted to have a
large postvoid residual of 300 cc. It was felt that this might be
related in part to mild benign prostatic hypertrophy. Dr. Nydam ,
his primary care physician , is aware and will pursue further
work-up as necessary.
PROBLEM #3: ATAXIA. The patient was noted by the family members
to be somewhat ataxic at home. The onset of this
ataxia was in relation to his current illness; however , given the
fact that he was on Coumadin , and due to the fact that he had
sustained a fall in the evening of admission , a CT scan was
performed to rule out a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The CT scan was
negative for hemorrhage and showed age-appropriate atrophy. A
Neurology consult was also requested , and recommendations for the
CT scan , as already discussed , were made. In addition , they
recommended that we check an RPR , B12 , folate , and TSH. The
results are as follows: RPR was nonreactive. The first draw of
B12 was 233 , which is slightly low normal. A repeat B12 was 564 ,
which is within normal limits. His folate was normal at 4.9. His
TSH was slightly low at 0.44. A Physical Therapy consult was also
obtained to assist the patient with exercises to improve his
strength. By discharge , the patient was able to ambulate without
difficulty. He was having no ataxia , whatsoever. We feel , in
part , that some of this ataxia may have been related to generalized
weakness that was associated with his current illness.
PROBLEM #4: DIABETES MELLITUS. On admission , the patient's
glucose was 194. Due to his oral intake , we elected
to hold his Glyburide and to give him insulin subcu. on a sliding
scale basis as needed. By hospital day #4 , the patient's p.o.
intake had improved , and we resumed Glyburide 5 mg. p.o. q. day
with sliding scale p.r.n. We continued Accucheks on a b.i.d.
basis. His glucose tended to run in the low 200s. His glucose
will need to be followed as an outpatient , and perhaps one might
consider a glucometer for him at home to ensure that he has good
glucose control.
PROBLEM #5: HEMATOLOGIC. The patient was admitted on Coumadin ,
which he takes as follows: 2.5 mg. alternating with
3 mg. On admission , his INR was 1.8. His INR was rechecked on
6/2/95 and was noted to be 4.8. His Coumadin was held for a couple
of days , and his INR was rechecked on the day of discharge; it was
2.4 on the day of discharge. We feel that the elevation in his INR
was probably related to his being on antibiotics. I have mentioned
this to his primary care doctor , Dr. Reimer He will follow up on
his clinic visit on Monday , 7/22/95.
LABORATORY PENDING ON DISCHARGE: Legionella antigen , obtained on
10/2/95. Repeat stool for
Clostridium difficile toxin on 1/5/95 ; however , the patient's
diarrhea has diminished , and we do not think that this is related
to Clostridium difficile.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 50 mg. p.o. q. day. Cardizem-SR
120 mg. p.o. b.i.d. Erythromycin 500 mg.
p.o. q.i.d. x eight days. Glyburide 5 mg. p.o. q. day. Lovastatin
20 mg. p.o. q. day. Coumadin 2 mg. p.o. q. day. Nitroglycerin 0.4
mg. tablets sublingual q. five minutes x three p.r.n. chest pain;
the patient is to notify the M.D. if the pain fails to resolve
after three tablets or if he should become light-headed while
taking those tablets.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Good.
DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged to home.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow up with Dr. Elvis Alcantas in
clinic on Monday , 7/22/95.
