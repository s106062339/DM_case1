CHIEF COMPLAINT: The patient is a 42-year-old woman
admitted for treatment of two pulmonary
embolisms and a urinary tract infection.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Pulmonary embolisms times two.
2. Urinary tract infection.
3. Status post total abdominal
hysterectomy.
PRESENT ILLNESS: Twenty years ago the patient suffered a
pulmonary embolism which was poorly
documented after a tubal ligation. She was treated with heparin
and Coumadin. Since that time she has been well. On 21 of April
the patient underwent elective total abdominal hysterectomy
secondary to fibroids and menorrhagia. On 22 of May , the night
before discharge , the patient noted the onset of sharp pleuritic
chest pain upon movement in bed. It was felt this was musculo-
skeletal and she was discharged. While at home before admission ,
the patient noted some shortness of breath and a temperature to
101. She continued to have a pleuritic chest pain and came to
the emergency room. She was admitted on 17 of November
Past medical history: ( 1 ) Pulmonary embolism. ( 2 ) Cholecys-
tectomy. ( 3 ) Costochondritis. ( 4 ) Status post TAH for
fibroids. ( 5 ) Asthma.
The patient's family history is notable for a cousin with lupus.
The patient doesn't smoke. The patient drinks occasionally.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was an obese women who
appeared tired and was having some
discomfort breathing. Her temperature in the emergency room was
102.5. Her blood pressure was 110/80. Heart rate was 120.
Respirations were 32 which went down to 24 as she calmed down.
Her O2 saturation on room air was 99%. An ABG was not done. Head
was unremarkable. Neck was supple. Lungs were clear without a
rub. Cardiac exam shows regular rate and rhythm without murmurs
appreciated. Abdomen was soft and has bowel sounds. The wound
had its dressing in place and there was a small amount of
serosanguinous drainage appreciated. It was nontender.
Neurologic exam was nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: Electrolytes were within normal limits.
BUN 6 , creatinine 0.8 , glucose 114 ,
white count 12.2 , hematocrit 26 , platelets 508 , 000. PT 13.4 , PTT
25.6. Chest x-ray showed bilateral basilar atelectasis. EKG
showed sinus tachycardia at 104 with normal interval and axis.
There was T-wave inversion in 3 and V1 without other ST-T wave
changes. VQ scan obtained prior to admission was read as low
probability.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and started on
heparin. The PTT was quickly thera-
peutic. The patient had informal noninvasive studies , mainly
ultrasound of the thighs which failed to show deep venous
thrombosis. She , therefore , underwent on the second hospital day
pulmonary angiography which showed two small pulmonary embolisms
on the left side. In the meantime , her VQ scan had been reinter-
preted as showing intermediate probability with notch defect on
left and right. The patient had been started on Coumadin.
In the meantime , after her procedure she developed a procedure.
She had some dysuria. Her urine had white cells and bacteria and
eventually grew out Enterobacter aerogenes. In the meantime she
was treated with ceftizoxime and defervesced and was converted to
p.o. Bactrim and remained afebrile. The Enterobacter was sensi-
tive to this antibiotic. The patient was discharged on 1 mg
p.o. q. h.s. of Coumadin with a PT the preceding day of 19.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient's condition is good.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be transferred to the
Critmi Ganstown Community Medical Center under the care of
Dr. Jamie Perman who is the patient's primary care physician.
A PT will need to be checked on arrival. Most likely the
patient's PT will be in the range of 18 to 20 and she will need
approximately 1 mg p.o. of Coumadin.
Discharge medications: Bactrim one double strength tablet p.o.
b.i.d.; iron sulfate 325 mg p.o. q.d.; Motrin 800 mg p.o. t.i.d.;
Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.; Coumadin 1 mg p.o. q. h.s.
