4 ) Heme - on coumadin after surgery in 9/21 , should have stopped taking
it. INR 7.3 on admission so holding all anticoagulation
5 ) Prophy: hold DVT prophy for now given INR , ppi
6 ) Pain: nightly has 10 second episodes of apnea , snoring , bradypnea to
6-8/min with O2 desats to mid 80's on RA. Could be oversedation with
narcotics though she exhibited these episodes even when holding narcs ,
so more likely Pickwickian syndrome , will need a sleep study as
outpatient. She continues to complain of 8/10 pain even on her home
regimen of oxycontin/oxycodone , so we tried adding dilaudid and
morphin IR for breakthrough pain. Due to her apneic episodes and the
fact that she has not moved her bowels since admission we stopped these
and decreased her oxycontin by half to 10mg bid. Per pain service recs ,
we discontinued trazadone and added neurontin , as trazodone could be
contributing to her daily drowsiness , and neurontin may help with her
chronic pain. On discharge , we will not add any new narcotics. F/u pain
service as outpt.
