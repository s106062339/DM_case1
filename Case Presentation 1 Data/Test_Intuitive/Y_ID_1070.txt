FAMILY HISTORY: No family history of heart disease.
PHYSICAL EXAM: On presentation , T 97.3 , BP 143/70 , pulse 57 , 98%
on 2 liters. This is an obese female in no apparent distress ,
sitting up in bed. HEENT: Extraocular movements intact. Sclerae
anicteric. Neck: Supple , JVP at 14 cm. Chest: Crackles
bilaterally , left greater than right , half way up both lung
fields with mild decreased breath sounds at the bases.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 and S2. No
murmur , rubs , or gallops. Abdomen: Soft , nontender , and
nondistended with positive bowel sound and no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities with 3+ edema as well as areas of erythematous and
shiny shallow ulcerations. Neurologically , euthymic without
focal deficits.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , significant for sodium 147 ,
potassium 3.4 , chloride 110 , CO2 26 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.6 , and
glucose 69. CBC was significant for white count of 6.7 ,
hematocrit 39.4 , and platelets of 258. Her CK was 432. Her
troponin was less than assay. Her BNP was greater than assay and
D-dimer was 50 and 69.
Chest x-ray showed decreased lung volumes with moderate cardiac
enlargement. EKG showed sinus bradycardia with a rate of 59 ,
axis of -36 and no acute changes.
ASSESSMENT: This is a 63-year-old woman with history of
congestive heart failure who presented with likely congestive
heart failure exacerbation.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: There was concern regarding acute
and subacute silent ischemia given new ST-T wave changes in
lateral leads on the EKG. The patient was continued on her
aspirin as well as statin. She was ruled out for an MI with
negative troponins x 3. She was continued on a low-dose
short-acting beta-blocker ( Lopressor ). She was also continued on
an ACE inhibitor with this switched to captopril as a
short-acting ACE inhibitor , which was titrated up as tolerated
for a goal blood pressure of systolic of 120. An adenosine MIBI
was performed which was negative for perfusion defects. However ,
echo showed global hypokinesis with depressed ejection fraction.
Cardiology consult was called and they recommended further workup
with cardiac catheterization. However , the patient refused the
catheterization.
Rhythm: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation.
However , she remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout her
admission. She was monitored by cardiac telemetry with several
episodes of 6 to 10 beats of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia. Her electrolytes were carefully monitored and
repleted as necessary. She remained asymptomatic with the runs
of NSVT and was continued on her beta-blocker. Given her history
of atrial fibrillation as well as depressed ejection fraction ,
she was restarted on Coumadin.
Pump: The patient presented with a frank fluid overload with
elevated JVP , lower extremity edema , and a BNP greater than
assay. She was aggressively diuresed with a goal of greater than
-2 liters a day. She responded to 80 mg of IV Lasix t.i.d. Her
creatinine was carefully followed and did increase on 11/26/03 ,
at which point diuresis was put on hold. The patient diuresed
about 3 to 4 liters each day during her hospital stay until
7/7/03. At this point , she was thought to be very close to
euvolemic.
Given the patient's echo findings with depressed ejection
fraction and global hypokinesis , a workup for dilated
cardiomyopathy was begun. The patient did not wish for further
investigation with cardiac catheterization or a cardiac MRI. Her
other labs were unremarkable including a TSH , which was normal ,
an ANA which was negative , iron studies which did not show iron
overload , and thiamine which is pending at the time of this
dictation. The patient will require close followup with careful
fluid balance monitoring as well as followup with congestive
heart failure service.
Pulmonary: She initially presented with shortness of breath.
However , this resolved with diuresis. She has a history of PE as
well as DVT and an elevated dimer was found on admission. There
was initial concern for pulmonary embolism , but the resolution of
symptoms with diuresis and a history that was not suggestive of
pulmonary emboli , did not require further followup with spiral
chest CT.
Heme: The patient's hematocrit was followed. The patient has
chronic folate and iron-deficiency anemia and she was continued
on folate and iron replacement.
Endocrine: The patient was continued on NPH 20 units for her
known diabetes. Her blood sugars were in excellent control on
this regimen. Avandia was held given it contraindication in
heart failure.
Renal: The patient's creatinine was 1.6 on admission , which is up
from about 0.8 in October of 2003. Her urine eosinophils and
sediment were unremarkable , but frank proteinuria was noted which
is consistent with her known nephrotic syndrome. Her creatinine
remained stable in the 1.5 to 1.6 range until 11/26/03 , when her
creatinine bumped to 2 and kept rising until 1/28/03 , when it
reached 2.7. Repeat urine electrolytes , urine eosinophils and
sediment were sent at this point and they are pending at the time
of this dictation. The most likely explanation for increasing
creatinine was aggressive diuresis and intravascular volume
depletion. Diuresis was put on hold on 11/2/03 and 10/10/03.
Given her increased creatinine , her ACE inhibitor dose was halfed
on 10/10/03. The plan is to continue to monitor her creatinine
function , follow up on her urine chemistries and if her
creatinine resolves , to resume gentle diuresis as necessary.
Infectious Disease: The patient was found to have a UTI with E.
Coli that was sensitive to Bactrim and she was treated with
Bactrim with resolution.
Rheumatological: The patient with known chronic pain as well as
arthritis. Her Celebrex was held given her increased creatinine
and its propensity to cause fluid retention. Her joint exam
revealed swollen PIP joints of both hands as well as marked
swelling over both wrists. A rheumatoid factor was sent and that
came back negative. For her pain , she was given oxycodone p.r.n.
Once her acute renal failure resolves , she may be transitioned
to Celebrex or other antiinflammatory medications which may be
more effected for her arthritis. ANA came back negative.
Psyche: She was continued on Celexa for depression.
Code status: Full code.
FOLLOWUP: The patient needs to follow up with the congestive
heart failure service as well as her primary care physician.
