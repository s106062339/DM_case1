ATTENDING: BLAKE CULBERSON MD
The patient was on the Re Hospital
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Small bowel obstruction.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is an 80-year-old woman with a
past medical history of incarcerated umbilical hernia. She also
has a history of coronary artery disease. She presented with one
day of substernal chest pain , shortness of breath , and nausea.
The patient has normal angina pain , which is usually treated with
nitroglycerin , but she had run out. The chest pain had resolved
with nitroglycerin given in the ambulance. The patient also
complained of having abdominal pain for the past few days with
some nausea. Her last bowel movement was two days before
admission with no flatus for the past two days as well. The
abdominal pain was worst today. The patient was felt to have a
partial small bowel obstruction in the emergency room and was
evaluated by both the surgical service and the medical service.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Incarcerated umbilical hernia and a mitral
valve replacement with a St. Jude valve in 1990. She had
coronary artery disease with a clean catheterization in 2001 ,
hypertension , diabetes , diverticulitis , status post a sigmoid
colectomy , and atrial fibrillation controlled with Coumadin 3.5
mg q.d.
MEDICATIONS: Lasix 80 mg q.d. , Glyburide 5 mg q.d. , Lisinopril
20 mg q.d. , Norvasc 10 mg q.d. , Coumadin 3.5 mg q.d. , Isordil 20
mg three times a day , amiodarone 200 mg once a day.
ALLERGIES: She has allergies to aspirin , penicillin , and
sotalol.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives alone with no smoking and no alcohol
use.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: Vital signs: Temperature was 96.8 ,
heart rate was 76 , respiratory rate was 18 , blood pressure
152/79 , O2 saturation was 94% on two liters. In general , she was
in no acute distress and pleasant. Cardiovascular exam: She had
an irregular rhythm with audible S1 and S2. No S3 was heard. No
murmurs. No jugular venous distension. Chest was clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Her abdomen had increased bowel
sounds , was tympanitic , was diffusely tender. Her extremities
had no edema.
LABS: She had a white blood cell count of 14 , hematocrit of 42 ,
platelets of 221 , 000 , sodium of 144 , potassium of 4 , chloride of
109 , bicarb of 28 , BUN of 20 , creatinine of 1.6 , blood glucose of
200 , troponin I was less than assay , CK was 118 , INR of 2.6. KUB
x-ray showed dilated loops of small bowel consistent with small
bowel obstruction. EKG showed atrial fibrillation at 78 beats
per minute with an incomplete right bundle branch block , an old
inferior MI with loss of anterior fossa.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient's abdominal pain was most likely
due to small bowel obstruction secondary to a ventral hernia. It
was decided by the surgical service that the ventral hernia
should be fixed operatively. The medical service evaluated the
patient , decided that her chest pain was her normal baseline
angina and she had no acute coronary syndrome at the time of
admission. Recommendations were made to discontinue her
Coumadin , allow her INR to fall to 1.8 before operating. The
patient was also to be given generous boluses of normal saline
preoperatively to avoid hypotension and tight blood sugar control
during her hospital course. The patient was admitted to the
medical floor before her operation and was scheduled for ventral
hernia repair several days later. During her stay on the
surgical ward , the patient had developed complaints of new visual
changes described as objects of floating in her visual field. At
this point , a CT scan of the head was done to rule out an acute
cerebral avascular accident. Head CT was initially read as
normal. No acute bleed. However re-read as showing a left-sided
sub acute thalamic infarct of 10 days to 2 weeks age. At this
point , a neurological consultation was obtained. The neurology
consultant recommended an MRI/MRA of the head and neck to
evaluate for possible hidden acute stroke and a carotid
ultrasound to assess her carotid artery patency. The MRI/MRA of
her head was negative , a carotid ultrasound was done which was
also negative with no lesions similar to her previous carotid
artery ultrasound of 10/1 A transthoracic echocardiogram was
also done to evaluate for atrial clots. Her echocardiogram was
largely unchanged from her previous echocardiogram of 2002. She
had normal left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of
55% and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Given this negative
workup for any acute stroke , it was decided to obtain an
ophthalmology consult to evaluate the patient's visual changes.
The ophthalmology consultant attributed her visual changes to
vitreous humor particulate matter , which is very common in older
people. It was most likely the cause of her visual changes. The
ophthalmology consultant recommended q.d. Pred Forte drops in
each eye for her status post corneal transplant.
The patient was finally taken to the operating room on hospital
day 7 for ventral hernia repair. The operation was uncomplicated
with minimal blood loss. Postoperatively , the patient's course
progressed well with good pain control , good progression of diet
and good ambulation. Postoperatively , the patient was restarted
on Coumadin and placed on IV heparin for prophylaxis secondary to
her mitral valve prosthetic. The patient remained in the
hospital for seven days after her operation for adequate
anticoagulation with Coumadin. On postop day 3 , the patient was
noticed to have bright red blood in her urine. A urological
consult was obtained for evaluation of gross hematuria. CAT scan
showed several centimeters of calcified bladder wall , which is
indicative of infection versus tumor. However no gross tumor
mass was observed and the remainder of her collecting system was
normal. The urological consult recommended follow up in Urology
Clinic in two to four weeks. The patient was then discharged on
postop day 7 to the Awind Pitwell Medical Center for continued physical therapy.
