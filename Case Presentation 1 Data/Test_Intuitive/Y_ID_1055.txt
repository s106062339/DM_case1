A/P: 60 yo M with CAD , HTN and Hyperlipidemia admitted with
increasing DOE and intermidiate MIBI as out-pt in setting of
significant deconditioning and multiple cardiac risk
factors. 1. CV: i- no evidence of active ischemia. Admission
cardiac markers negative. Continued statin/high dose ASA ( post
stent )/started Plavix ( post stent )/increased atenolol from 100mg to 125
mg. Started Niaspan for low HDL ( Trig 138 , HDL 38 , LDL 85 ). Subtotal RCA
occlusion , 80% OM , 50% mid LAD. Cypher Stents in mid RCA to os. Returned
to cath lab for
Lcx PCI 6/26 and cypher stent placed. Wedge elevated. EF 45% on stress
echo. Difficult to determine volume status by clinical exam alone.
Increased lasix from 40 mg PO daily to 80 mg PO BID , increased b-blocker ,
continued norvasc and stopped isordil. Will stop norvasc to allow room
for ACE-I titration. r-telemetry
monitoring revealed 2 episodes of NSVT post-PCI. Continue ASA/Plavix at
current doses x 1 year. 2. PULM: likely symptoms
related to cardiac etiology.
No evidence of PE per out-pt scan within the last week. 3. ID: lower
extremity cellulitis in setting of

keflex x 2 weeks and continue longer if legs still erythematous. ABX
started 1/10 , stop 6/17 4. FEN: cardiac diet. Started low dose potassium
10 mEq daily as increased lasix. Will have patient check lytes in 2 days.
