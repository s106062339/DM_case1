Discharge Date: 9/14/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
OTHER DIAGNOSES:
1. SARCOIDOSIS.
2. HYPERTENSION.
3. NON-INSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS.
4. STATUS POST PACEMAKER PLACEMENT.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65-year-old female
with a history of hypertension ,
hypercholesterolemia , non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , and
with no known hx of CAD admitted with chest pain. She has had
several days of exertional chest pain characterized by substernal
burning pain which , at times , radiates to the left shoulder. It is
sometimes accompanied by shortness of breath without nausea and
occasional diaphoresis. She was seen in the Emergency Department
with chest pain on June , 1997 , with negative troponins and
negative cardiac enzymes. An exercise treadmill test on April , 1997 , for three minutes revealed a maximal heart rate of 127
and maximal blood pressure of 134/80. She experienced chest pain
with 1 millimeter of ST depression in V5 and T-wave inversions in
V4-V6. This study was interpreted as consistent with , but not
diagnostic ischemia. She was started on aspirin and atenolol. On the
morning of admission , she was walking to catch a bus and had an
episode of substernal chest burning lasting less than 10 minutes
with shortness of breath , but no nausea , vomiting , or diaphoresis.
She came by cab to Rirel Carleo And for her scheduled
exercise ett/mibi test study and was noted to have T wave
inversions in II , III , F , and V3-V6.
On arrival to the Emergency Room , the patient was pain free. She
denied lower extremity edema and had mild orthopnea which was
unchanged. She denied bright red blood per rectum , and stools were
black secondary to iron supplementation. Hematocrit on November ,
1997 , was noted to be 29.3. The patient had been iron supplements
since that time. She had a history of colonic polyps.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Significant for a history of
sarcoidosis. Her last pulmonary test was in
April 1995 which showed an FEV 1 of 1.61 , 72% of predicted; FEV
1 ratio to FVC was 80 or 102% of predicted. FVC was 2.01 or 72% of
predicted. In the past , she has been treated with prednisone and
now uses Ventolin inhalers p.r.n. 2 ) History of seizure disorder.
3 ) Status post pacemaker placement in October 1996 for tachycardia
bradycardia syndrome. 4 ) Status post appendectomy. 5 ) Status
post total abdominal hysterectomy for cervical cancer. 6 ) Adult
onset diabetes mellitus , diet-controlled. 7 ) History of left calf
deep vein thrombosis in 1993. 8 ) History of colonic polyps with a
colonic adenoma diagnosed in 1993.
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION: Linsinopril 5 mg q.d.;
Pravachol 20 mg q.h.s.;
aspirin 325 mg q. day; atenolol 0.5 mg b.i.d.; Dilantin 200 mg
b.i.d.; Ventolin inhaler p.r.n.; ferrous gluconate 325 mg t.i.d.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin and erythromycin , gives rash.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was a pleasant female in no acute
distress. Vital signs revealed a
temperature of 97.9; heart rate 78; blood pressure 120/70;
respiratory rate 19. Saturation was 99% on two liters. Head ,
eyes , nose , and throat examination: Pupils were equal , round , and
reactive to light. Extraocular movements intact. Oropharynx was
clear and edentulous. Jugular venous pressure was 8 centimeters.
No lymphadenopathy. Carotids were 2+ bilaterally , no bruits.
Lungs: Diffuse , dry rales. No wheezes. Cardiac: Regular rate
and rhythm. S4 present. 1/6 systolic murmur heard at upper left
sternal border. Abdomen: Cholecystectomy scar. Infraumbilical
midline scar. No masses. No hepatosplenomegaly. Positive bowel
sounds. Rectal: Guaiac negative per the Emergency Room.
Extremities: Femoral pulses were 2+ bilaterally. No bruits. No
lower extremity edema. Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis
pulses were 2+ bilaterally. Nonfocal neurological examination. No
motor or sensory deficits.
LABORATORY DATA: Chest x-ray: Bilateral parenchymal opacities ,
most prominent in the right upper lung fields.
Stable and consistent with previous examinations from May ,
1997 , consistent with chronic sarcoidosis. Pacer wires were in
good position. Electrocardiogram on admission , April , 1997 in
the Emergency Room , normal sinus rhythm at 66. T-wave inversion in
I , T-wave inversion in II and AVF , biphasic T-waves in V2 , and
T-wave inversions in V3-V6. Slightly pronounced when compared with
previous electrocardiogram.
Sodium 143; potassium 5.1; chloride 108; bicarbonate 23; BUN 36;
creatinine 1.8; glucose 255. White count 6700; hematocrit 30.9;
platelets 143 , 000; MCV 85.1. Prothrombin time was 11.4. Partial
thromboplastin time was 25.2. INR was 0.9. CK was 79. Troponin
0.0. Dilantin: Less than assay. Hematocrit on November , 1997 ,
was 29.3. Cholesterol total was 258; LDH 43; LDL 166.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Talburt was admitted for a rule out myocardial
infarction protocol and underwent serial
electrocardiograms and her enzymes were studied. She was started
on Nitrol paste. Aspirin , linsinopril , and atenolol , were
continued. Given her low hematocrit as a possible etiology for
her ischemia , she was transfused with one unit of packed red cells.
Stools were guaiac neg and anemia workup was initiated. She was
continued on her albuterol inhale and nebulizers p.r.n.
On February , 1997 , the patient underwent cardiac catheterization
which showed a 70% residual osteal diagonal stenosis , 0% left
anterior descending stenosis. A stent was placed in the diagonal
artery with 0% residual stenosis. Later than evening , the patient
began to complain of severe left arm pain radiating to her left
chest. Her electrocardiogram changes showed ST elevation in VI and
VII , and T-wave more inverted in VIV. She received morphine and
was already on a nitroglycerin drip , and she was taken back to the
catheterization laboratory. Her spectral study on February ,
1997 , revealed a 90% mid left anterior descending and 95% VI , and
her left anterior descending was stented at this time.
Following her two cardiac catheterizations , she experienced
intermittent atypical chest which was transient in nature without
sustaining any electrocardiogram changes. Her cardiac enzymes were
significant for a CK of 409 with an MB fraction o 21.
On October , 1997 , it was noted that her creatinine had risen to
3.1 , elevated from a level of 1.9 before the catheterization and a
diagnosis of radial contrast induced nephrotoxicity was made. Her
creatinine rose and rose to a peak level of 5.1 on May ,
1997 , and then began to decrease. At the time of discharge , it was
down to 2.2. The patient continued to have excellent urine output
throughout the rise in her creatinine and was normal by the time of
discharge.
Her laboratories at the time of discharge were a sodium of 141;
potassium 4.8; chloride 106; bicarbonate 20; BUN 31; creatinine
2.2; glucose 90. White count 6900; hematocrit 33.9; platelets were
203 , 000. She had an exercise tolerance test and ED study on
June , 1997 , which showed an essentially negative exercise
treadmill test and was a suboptimal study. She exercised for
approximately five minutes on submaximal exercise treadmill test
protocol with no evidence of ischemia , but low exercise tolerance.
Her medications at the time of discharge included: Ticlid 250 mg
p.o. b.i.d.; albuterol inhaler 2 puffs q.i.d. as needed for
shortness of breath; enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.;
atenolol 37.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.; nitroglycerin 1/150 sublingual one
tablet q. 5 minutes times three for chest pain; and Dilantin 200 mg
p.o. b.i.d.
She is scheduled to followup with Dr. Doug Millis in her office
in one week and will follow up with cardiology as an outpatient.
