Discharge Date: 2/1/2001
CHIEF COMPLAINT: LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY NUMBNESS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Milo Barta is a 78-year-old
African American female with a
significant cardiac history , including hypertension , congestive
heart failure , history of afib -- patient is on Coumadin , CAD ,
status post MI , mitral valve replacement in 1995 or so , who was in
her usual state of health until the morning of admission , when she
says she awoke in a sweat , had a headache , and noticed she could
not stand. She felt that her left lower extremity was "asleep" and
weak. She called 911 , came to PCH . The patient also noted that
her speech seemed slurred at the time that she was unable to get
up. She denied any weakness or numbness in her other extremities
or face. She denied any chest pain , shortness of breath , or visual
changes. She says she did note transient heart palpitations. She
denied fever , chills , nausea , and vomiting. In the ER the patient
was noted to have 2/5 left lower extremity power. She had no
apparent sensory deficits at that time.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above , and including noninsulin dependent
diabetes mellitus , a status post left hip
replacement , history of DVT , status post mitral valve replacement
for mitral stenosis approximately eight years ago ( patient says she
has a history of rheumatic fever ) , and bilateral cataracts.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Norvasc 10 mg q. day , amiodarone 200 mg
q. day , Isordil 20 mg t.i.d. , Lasix 40
mg q. day , Coumadin 5 mg Monday , Wednesday , and Friday and 2.5 mg
Tuesday , Thursday , Saturday , and Sunday , Lomotil 1-2 mg q.i.d.
p.r.n. , glyburide 5 mg b.i.d. , and Prinivil 20 mg q. day.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Patient denied any history of tobacco , ethanol , or
illicit drug use. She lives alone and says she is
a very private person. She does all of her own activities of daily
living and walks with a cane.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient's mother died of an MI and her father
apparently died of a PE. She has a son that died
of an MI as well.
ALLERGIES: The patient has an allergy to penicillin , sulfa drugs ,
and aspirin.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As per HPI.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On being admitted to the hospital , the
patient was afebrile at 97.4 degrees
Fahrenheit , with a pulse of 68 , blood pressure of 190/90 , and
satting 98% on room air. Patient's exam showed that she had no
carotid bruits or JVD. Her heart exam was notable for a regular
rate and rhythm , as well as prosthetic S1. Her lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally and abdominal exam was benign.
Extremities showed cool fingers on the right , with a 1+ pulse , and
warm well perfused fingers on the left , with a 2+ radial pulse.
Apparently , these extremity changes are long-standing and not new.
She had 2+ pulses in her posterior tibial pulses and trace pulses
in her dorsalis pedes pulses bilaterally. On neuro exam the
patient was alert and oriented x three. She exhibited good naming ,
comprehension , reading , and fluency. Cranial nerves II-XII were
intact bilaterally. On motor exam the patient had 5/5 power
everywhere except for the left lower extremity , with knee flexors ,
knee extensors , ankle flexors , and ankle extensors being 3+/5 and
hip flexors and hip extensors being 4-/5. Her tone was slightly
increased in her left lower extremity. On sensory exam she had
slightly reduced sensation to pinprick , light touch , and
temperature in both extremities to the hip. Deep tendon reflexes
were symmetric and 2+ throughout , with downgoing toes bilaterally.
Pertinent labs on admission showed a slightly increased creatinine
at 1.7 and a BUN of 31. The patient had a TSH of 1.09 and a total
cholesterol of 197 , with an LDL of 131. Her sed. rate was 14 and
her hematocrit was 40.2. INR was noted to be 1.7. CKs were flat
and the patient was ruled out for an MI.
IMPRESSION:
1. Neurologic: Given the patient's significant cardiac history
and subtherapeutic INR , it was considered that her left lower
extremity weakness that was transient was likely a transient
ischemic attack. The patient's motor deficits quickly improved
over her hospital stay and she felt she was back to baseline on the
day of discharge. Head CT and head MRI and MRA were negative for
any acute changes , including hemorrhage and infarction. On MRA the
patient was noted to have some proximal stenosis of her right
intracranial carotid and had also some atherosclerotic changes of
her PCAs bilaterally. The patient also had ATTE with a bubble
study that was negative for PFO. The patient was continued on her
Coumadin at 5 mg q.h.s. until her INR was therapeutic. During this
interval she was started on heparin and was therapeutic on that.
The patient is to follow up in the Coumadin clinic as well as
neurology clinic in one month. She is to have her Coumadin drawn
at three days after discharge to ensure that her INR is above 2.
Her Coumadin dosing regimen was slightly changed , with her taking
four doses of 5 mg a week and three doses of 2.5 mg a week. The
patient was seen by physical therapy , who cleared her to go home
and felt that she was okay to walk stairs with her walker.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient has an extensive cardiac history
as detailed above. Her systolic blood pressure was calculated
between 120 and 160 during the first day of her hospital stay , as
it was unclear whether she had a serious carotid stenosis or not.
Her blood pressure meds were gradually added back. The patient had
several episodes of atypical chest pain , for which she was ruled
out with telemetry and enzymes , which were flat.
3. Endocrine: The patient was placed on a diabetic diet and was
continued on her glyburide. A hemoglobin A1C is pending at the
time of this dictation. She was covered with sliding scale insulin
during her hospital stay.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Amiodarone 200 mg q. day , Norvasc 10 mg
q. day , Isordil 20 mg t.i.d. , Lasix 40
mg q. day , Coumadin 5 mg Monday , Wednesday , Friday , and Sunday , and
2.5 mg Tuesday , Thursday , and Saturday , glyburide 5 mg b.i.d. ,
Lasix 40 mg q. day , and Prinivil 20 mg q. day.
