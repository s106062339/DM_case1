HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Mcguirl is a 44 year old man with a
history of hypertension and a family
history of coronary artery disease who presents with new onset of
chest pain. He has been previously treated at the PH for
hypertension. He has no cardiac history , no prior history of chest
pain. He ran out of his blood pressure medicines approximately one
week prior to presentation. He was feeling well until the day of
admission while at work when he noted onset of substernal chest
pain while seated. He was diaphoretic , nauseated , but had no
vomiting. He also had some shortness of breath but no
palpitations. He went to SH with the same pain and an
electrocardiogram showed LVH with strain. He was given oxygen and
sublingual Nitroglycerin without relief. He was sent to the
Rahoag Hospital emergency room. There , he was treated
with Magnesium Sulfate , IV Lopressor , IV Nitroglycerin , and
sublingual Nifedipine. His blood pressure at WMC had been 210/150.
His pain then resolved with a total of approximately five hours.
He was entirely pain-free since his treatment in the emergency
room. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for only hypertension. He
was on three medications which he is unsure of , including
Captopril. He apparently had good blood pressure control with his
blood pressure medication. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Captopril of unknown dose; Hydrochloro-
thiazide 15 mg po q day; Diltiazem of unknown dose. FAMILY
HISTORY: Significant for his father who died of myocardial
infarction at age 50. SOCIAL HISTORY: He works as a plumber at
Hunt Ca He does not drink and does not smoke.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He is a middle-aged , black man , in no
apparent distress. His blood pressure was
140/100 , pulse 76 , afebrile. Head and neck exam showed PERRL ,
oropharynx was benign. Neck was supple and no adenopathy. Lungs
were clear to auscultation. His cardiovascular exam revealed a
regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , an S4 gallop. No
murmurs or rubs , no jugular venous distention , and his carotids
were 2+ bilaterally. Abdomen; good bowel sounds , no hepato-
splenomegaly , no masses. Extremities; no clubbing , cyanosis , or
edema. Neurologic exam was non-focal.
LABORATORY EVALUATION: potassium 4.9 , BUN 11 , creatinine 1.1 ,
glucose 134 , hematocrit 44.6 , white count of
11 , and platelets of 223. CK was 215. PT was 12.1 , PTT 30.1. His
electrocardiogram showed him to be in normal sinus rhythm at 83
beats per minute , normal intervals , axis was -29. He did have LVH
with strain. His chest x-ray showed no pulmonary vascular
redistribution , no effusions or infiltrates.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted to the coronary care unit
and ruled in for a myocardial infarction. His
peak CK was 453 with MB fraction of 16.5. He was in the coronary
care unit for one day , after which he was transferred to the floor.
He had no arrhythmias or complications of his myocardial
infarction. Echocardiogram was obtained which showed moderate
concentric LVH with moderate chamber enlargement , posterolateral
hypokinesis , and ejection fraction of 45% , and moderate mitral
regurgitation with thickened mitral valve leaflets. His
hypertension was initially controlled with Lopressor 150 mg three
times a day. He was then changed to Atenolol and Captopril. With
these medications , he had good blood pressure control. One week
after his myocardial infarction , he underwent an exercise tolerance
test MIBI. He went for 9 minutes on his exercise tolerance test
and stopped due to completion of his protocol. He had no chest
pain or shortness of breath and no ischemic changes on his EKG , and
reached a peak blood pressure of 180/85 and a peak pulse of 94.
His MIBI images showed a fixed defect in the apical anterior
lateral wall , but no reversible changes , consistent with myocardial
infarction but no ischemia. He is discharged to home in stable
condition.
DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 100 mg po q day , aspirin
325 mg po q day , Lisinopril 10 mg po q day ,
