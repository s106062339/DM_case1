REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Upon finding Mr. Nadal it was notable of the
fact that he had missed hemodialysis the previous week. He was
intubated for airway protection. A head CT was normal on his
arrival to the hospital and his potassium of 6.9 was treated with
calcium , insulin bicarbonate and glucose. He received
Vancomycin , levofloxacin and Flagyl. He was admitted to the
Medical ICU. In the Medical ICU the metabolic acidosis was
thought to be secondary to diabetic ketoacidosis combined with
uremia. A tox screen was negative. An EEG showed diffuse
slowing. The patient was reinitiated on hemodialysis. Sputum
from his lungs grew out serratia that was pan sensitive and the
patient was put on Vancomycin and Ceftaz after spiking fevers.
His right internal jugular tunneled catheter was removed even
though his fistula was partly infiltrated. The patient was
extubated on 8/7/06 , his mental status improved , and the
patient was sent to the floor.
