BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Pt is an 82 year old woman with long standing hereditary
angioedema who was admitted with symptoms consistent with an angioedema
flare. Pt reports one day of crampy abdominal pain with associated
bilious vomiting. These symptoms are consistent with her previous
angiodedema flares.
Normally , patient manages her symptoms by increasing her danazol dose
at home , but this time the increase was not enough to stabilize
her symptoms. Thus , she came to the ED to get FFP , which helps with
flares by repleting the missing complement factors.
Pt's first attack was when she was 10. Pt has had multiple flares this
past year including 6 admissions. She has had 3 tracheostomies in
the past for flares threatening her respiratory system. Her GI
complications include multiple scarring/strictures - is scheduled for a
dilitation with GI next month. She has also had surgery in the past
( 1994 )
She thinks her trigger this admission is multiple stressors involving
the health of many of her family members.

Hospital Course and Plan
82 year old woman with hereditary angioedema admitted with abdominal
flare of her HAE , most likely triggered by stress.
1. HAE: Pt much improved after receiving FFP , benadryl and demerol.
Temporarily increased her danazol , on day of discharge had started on h
er home regimen. Her c1 inh , c4 , c2 were still pending at discharge.
2. ID: Pt was afebrile with no localizing symptoms , but w/ bandemia w/
her normal wbc ( 10% ). Will need monitoring as an outpatient. UA at
discharge was negative.
3.CV: Pt w/ HTN. on Atenolol. Pt w/ Afib. not on coumadin
currently. Unclear why her coumadin was stopped. Should discuss with
her PCP as outpatient.
4. Renal: Cr on admission 1.3. Normalized to 1.1. Likely
pre-renal secondary to dehydration during flare. Monitor as outpatient.
5. GI: Pt with scheduled dilitation of her known sricture next month.
