FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General: The patient was in no
acute distress. HEENT: Revealed a JVP at 8 to 9 cm of water.
Benign oropharynx. Moist mucous membranes. Pulmonary: Showed
no wheezes , rhonchi , or crackles , and a clear exam to
auscultation in both lung fields. Cardiovascular: Regular rate
and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2. No murmur , rub , or gallop
was appreciated. Abdomen: She had positive bowel sounds. She
was nontender and nondistended , obese , but no suprapubic
tenderness. No hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities: There is no
cyanosis , clubbing , or edema appreciated. She had 1+ dorsalis
pedis pulses bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA: Pertinent laboratory findings at the time of
admission include hematocrit of 36.3 , white count of 7.7 , and
platelets 317 , 000. Sodium 138 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 96 ,
bicarbonate 28 , BUN 102 , and creatinine 2.8. Glucose was 88.
Otherwise , she was not coagulopathic and normal liver function
tests , and a negative set of cardiac enzymes. Her EKG on
admission showed she was ventricularly paced at 54 beats per
minute and that her EKG was unchanged from her prior EKG from
September , 2005.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1. Cardiovascular pump: Initially , the patient's Imdur and
labetalol were held out of concern for hypertension and poor
renal perfusion. However , on the hospital day #1 without IV
hydration and holding of her p.o. blood pressure medications.
Her creatinine returned towards baseline , value is 2.3. As such ,
the patient was restarted on her home Imdur on February ,
2005. However , her spironolactone continued to be held. In
addition , her torsemide was held. Her urine output was
monitored , revealed that she put out over 2 L on her second
hospital day. As such , the patient was started on home dose of
beta-blocker Toprol-XL 50 mg p.o. daily on hospital day #2 as
well as once daily dosing of her torsemide 60 mg. The patient's
creatinine continued to improve. It was felt that the patient
was achieving good forward systolic flow and then her
hypertension was resolved with blood pressures ranging from the
130s to 150s on hospital day #2. However , over the course of
hospital admission , the patient was felt to be retaining fluid
with a weight of 99 kg , up from an admission weight of 97 kg. As
the patient had previous admissions for pulmonary edema and CHF
exacerbation , it was felt that the patient should be more
aggressively diuresed to prevent pulmonary edema. As such , the
patient restarted on her home torsemide 60 mg , however , continued
to gain weight and retained fluid. As such , the patient was
changed to 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. of Lasix 2 days prior to discharge
and was maintained on that dose achieving over 1 L of net
diureses on the 2 days prior to her discharge. She was
discharged on 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. of Lasix and achieves good effect
and maintaining adequate blood pressure.
2. Ischemia: The patient continued her home Lipitor and aspirin
doses for known coronary artery disease. However , overnight , the
evening of August , 2005 , and the morning of February ,
2005 , she developed irritant anginal pain radiating to her jaw.
Imdur had been held at admission for concern of hypertension , but
was restarted for her anginal pain and she responded well. There
were no EKG changes for this event , and her cardiac enzymes ,
which were excessive , currently negative. She was maintained on
aspirin , Lipitor , Imdur and p.r.n. sublingual nitroglycerin for
the remainder of her admission. She had no further chest pain
events.
3. Rhythm and rate: The patient was ventricularly paced and
maintained on telemetry. She was continued on her amiodarone 200
mg p.o. daily over her hospital course and tolerated this with
good effect. She also continued her Coumadin at 1.5 mg p.o.
daily for known atrial fibrillation and achieved a therapeutic PT
at 2.8. The patient had no complications or events from her
rhythm or rate standpoint.
4. Renal: The patient's creatinine returned to baseline by
hospital day #3. It was felt that her acute and chronic renal
failure may have been related to poor p.o. intake prior to
admission and subsequent hypovolemia. The patient had no further
issues from a renal standpoint and did not require aggressive
hydration , taking good p.o. On November , 2005 , the patient
developed an episode of 10/10 left flank pain with associated
nausea , but no vomiting , lasting 30 minutes , which she reported
was due to known gallstone in the neck of her gallbladder ,
identified by a CT of the abdomen without contrast within the
past year and by ultrasound in 2004. However , given the
dislocation of the pain , it was felt that this also may be
related to renal colic and as such , a CT of the abdomen stone
protocol was obtained on November , 2005 , which showed no
evidence of a kidney stone , however , did demonstrate once again
gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder. The patient responded
well to 30 mg p.o. codeine for pain control and had resolution of
her symptoms by August , 2005 , hospital day #3.
5. Gastrointestinal: The known biliary colic had resolved by
August , 2005. The patient was continued on p.r.n. codeine
p.o. 30 mg q.6h. and Tylenol 325 mg to 650 mg q.6h. p.r.n. The
patient did not require IV morphine , requesting not to use
narcotics , and had no further events of pain on her hospital
course.
6. Endocrine: The patient was initially started on her home
dose of NPH insulin 47 units q.a.m. and 20 units q.p.m. and
regular insulin sliding scale. The a.m. fingersticks were low ,
ranging from the 60s to the 70s as were her p.m. fingersticks.
This was felt to be due to decreased p.o. in the hospital
setting. As such , the diabetes service after consultation
recommended decreasing her NPH insulin dose to 35 units q.a.m.
and her p.m. insulin to 10 units q.p.m. The patient requested
minimal injections during her hospital course and at home. As
such , there was still preprandial insulin administered , as the
patient continued to express preference for twice daily
injections. The patient achieved goal fingersticks over her
hospital course and was discharged on regimen of NPH insulin. In
addition , a TSH was obtained during the hospital course which
showed a level of 19 , being elevated , as such her Synthroid was
increased to 150 mcg daily. She will follow up with her
endocrinologist to repeat her TSH and hemoglobin A1c.
7. Fluids , Electrolytes , Nutrition: The patient was restarted
on her K-Dur 40 mEq q.a.m. and 20 mEq q.p.m. for potassium loss
secondary to diureses. Her electrolytes remained stable over
course of her hospital stay. She was continued on a
low-cholesterol low-fat diet and ADA diet.
8. Infectious Disease: The patient had a UA with 8 to 10 white
blood cells , concerning for possible low-grade UTI , especially
given her initial presenting symptoms. As such , she was started
on a 3-day course of Bactrim , and completed this course. She
remained afebrile over the course of her hospitalization and her
urine culture , which showed only 50 , 000 colony-forming units of
mixed flora , her white blood cell count remained within normal
limits over her hospital admission. As such , no further therapy
was required.
9. The patient was discharged home on January , 2005 , with
VNA services.
PLAN FOLLOWING DISCHARGE:
1. To have her endocrinologist follow up her hemoglobin A1c and
to repeat her TSH level to maximize her insulin regimen as well
as her Synthroid regimen.
2. To have followup with Dr. Polashek in the Coumadin Clinic to
maximize her Coumadin therapy and ensure that she is therapeutic.
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:
1. Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. daily.
2. Coumadin 1.5 mg p.o. daily.
3. Aspirin 81 p.o. daily.
4. Colchicine 0.6 mg p.o. q.o.d.
5. Insulin NPH 35 units q.a.m. and 10 units q.p.m.
6. Synthroid 150 mcg p.o. daily.
7. Sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4-mg tablet 1 tablet every 5
minutes x3 days for p.r.n. chest pain.
8. Toprol-XL 25 mg p.o. daily.
9. Imdur 90 mg p.o. daily.
10. Potassium chloride slow release 40 mEq p.o. q.a.m.
11. Potassium chloride slow release 20 mEq p.o. q.p.m.
12. Lipitor 80 mg p.o. daily.
13. Nexium 20 mg p.o. daily.
14. Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.
The patient has followup appointments with Dr. Sam Rochholz on
January , 2005 , at 10 a.m. and with Dr. Jude Raheja on
July , 2005 , at 11 a.m.; both of which are scheduled.
