prior and now , has had a decompensation of heart failure for
three weeks , abdominal bloating and fatigue. Of note , she is on
clinical trial with implanted PA catheter placed in 2001. She
was seen in the heart failure clinic with systolic blood
pressures of 90 , baselines 110s-120s and baseline heart rate of
100s. She was admitted for diuresis and possible transplant work

A. Pumpwise , she is unclear trigger for compensation but low ACS
probably at that time. Had diuresed greater than 11 liters on
Lasix drip , Zaroxolyn and dobutamine at 2. Towards the end of
the hospitalization , even if slightly negative , she was changed
to torsemide p.o. Echo read no effusion and an EF of 15%
thrombus versus veg on device. Patient has implanted device
which measures p.o. pressures , again from the clinical trial. We
continued her ACE inhibitor , no beta-blocker given though poor
tolerance. She has continued on that. She had a right heart
cath on 2/12/04 showing very high SVR. Discharge was status
post steroid therapy , off nipride and dobutamine , transplant work
