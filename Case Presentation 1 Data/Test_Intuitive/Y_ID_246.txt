ATTENDING: KRAUS , RALEIGH LOUIS MD
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 67-year-old female
who is transferred from an outside hospital for further
management of her CHF. The patient is a 67-year-old female with
history of coronary artery disease who was first evaluated back
in 2002 when she had a stent placed at THC for symptomatic
coronary artery disease. She reports feeling well until 10/14
when she developed substernal chest burning and pressure and was
admitted to Trowestpot Allch Memorial Hospital , where a dobutamine echo was
positive for ischemia , details unclear and she was transferred to
IIAH for further care. At Deran Medical Center ,
angiography was performed on 8/7/06 with placement of a Cypher
stent in her LAD. The evening following discharge , the patient
reported severe substernal chest pressure and activated her local
EMS. On the way to the hospital , she suffered a Vfib arrhythmia
requiring CPR and 9 defibrillations. At Geft.o Ton Memorial Hospital ,
she was acutely intervened upon with PTCA and found to have a
thrombosed LAD stent. At this point , she was transferred to
R. Medical Center Of on an intraaortic balloon pump for
support. Repeat angiography was performed revealing suboptimal
deployment of the initial stent , which was subsequently outsized
to a diameter of 3.5 mm and additional stenting was performed
distal to the original stent with good anterograde flow noted
postprocedure. The patient was managed in the CCU , where she
remained intubated on the intraaortic balloon pump. Hospital
course was notable for distributive and cardiogenic shock as well
as aspiration pneumonia and HSV , treated with acyclovir. She
improved after two weeks and was discharged on 5/14/06 with an
EF of 40% at the time of discharge. The patient was readmitted
to Tacan Hospital And on 6/16/06 with a CHF exacerbation , was
subsequently diuresed and discharged on 1/27/06 .
Echocardiography at that time demonstrated an EF of 55% with 2 to
3+ MR and RVSP of 45 mmHg. The patient represented to Harl Hospital on 9/23/06 reporting progressive dyspnea , weight
gain , PND , orthopnea and cough. At that time , she underwent
repeat angiography demonstrating RA 14 , RV 55/13 , PA 61/25/42 ,
PCWP 35 with V 246 , LHC with AO 86/57. Angiography revealed a
right dominant circulation and LMCA , which was patent , LAD 20%
mid , D1 40% , ostial left circumflex 20% mid , RCA 60% prox , LV
gram with an EF of 25% associated with global hypokinesis and
severe MR. The patient was subsequently transferred to Palm Health Systems for further management of her advanced heart failure.

a clothing company. She smokes 1-2 packs per day x46 years until
nine years ago. No alcohol use. No illicits.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient reports coronary artery disease in
one sibling. No premature cardiac catheterization. Mother died
of cervical cancer. Father died of alcoholism.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient denies fever , chills , nausea ,

rectum , hematochezia , or melena , no chest pain or palpitations.
Positive for cough and shortness of breath. No changes in mental
status or loss of consciousness , no dysuria , no exposures. No
recent travel. No presyncope or dizziness.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Notable for creatinine of 1 from
baseline of 0.7 to 0.8. Hematocrit of 34 , baseline 37. ALT 68 ,
AST 33 and alkaline phosphatase 384 down from 616 on last
admission. INR 1. EKG , sinus rhythm at 90 , normal axis
intervals with old anterior septal MI.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Notable for afebrile , heart rate in the
90s , blood pressure 98/60 , respiratory rate 18-20 , satting 98% on
3 liters. The patient was in no acute distress , pleasant ,
resting comfortably. Oropharynx clear. JVP 10 cm with 2+
carotids without bruits. No thyromegaly , no lymphadenopathy.
Decreased breath sounds with bibasilar crackles with prolonged
expiratory phase and intermittent expiratory wheezing. Regular
rate and rhythm , S1 and S2. Notable S3 , no MR appreciated.
Abdomen was obese , distended , soft , nontender , no
hepatosplenomegaly. Positive bowel sounds. Extremities , 1+
lower extremity edema to the shins with 1+ DP and PT pulses
bilaterally. Pretibial erythema , right greater than left. No
other rashes. Right groin minimally tender without bruit. Cath
site clean , dry , intact. Neurologic exam is nonfocal.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: In summary , this is a 67-year-old female
with multiple cardiac risk factors including hypertension ,
hyperlipidemia , diabetes , coronary artery disease status post LAD
stent complicated by a subacute thrombosis with marked left
ventricular dysfunction with a reportedly revascularized right
coronary territory and severe MR on repeat echo. Despite
diuresis at the outside hospital , the patient remained volume
overloaded with biventricular failure on exam. The patient was
admitted to medically optimized heart failure regimen to further
clarify component of mitral regurgitation. Repeat TTE and right
and left heart catheterization to further evaluate and optimize
medical management. The patient was maintained on aspirin ,
Plavix , ARB , statin and Zetia. Beta-blocker was continued at low
dose given decompensated state. Adenosine MIBI was completed ,
which was notable for recovery 1 mm ST depressions in leads II ,
III and aVF , which resolved. There is no further evidence of
ischemia. EF was notable to be severely depressed; however ,
moderate MR on outside hospital echo was not reproducible here.
Cardiovascular surgery was initially consulted to further
evaluate for benefit of mitral valve replacement surgery;
however , this will likely not be of benefit given mild MR on
repeat echo. In addition a contrast echo was performed to
further evaluate for evidence of clot given the severe right
ventricle malfunction , and anticoagulation was started; however ,
there was no evidence of clot on echo. In addition , on echo ,
reevaluated for dyssynchrony , which was negative. The patient
was diuresed with IV Lasix until near euvolemic and then
transitioned to p.o. regimen. The patient was maintained on
Aldactone. The EP service evaluated for possible placement of
AICD versus biventricular pacemaker; however , given the patient
is not yet outside of three-month window and was noninducible on
EP study , she will need close monitoring as an outpatient with
repeat echo in 2 months and a further EP study to readdress. The
patient will be anticoagulated in the meantime. Respiratory:
The patient has history of COPD with no evidence of acute
exacerbation. Inhalers were continued. PFTs and VO2 study may
be considered as an outpatient. Renal: Creatinine was mildly
elevated compared with baseline , likely secondary to mild dye
nephropathy and overaggressive diuresis. Creatinine stabilized ,
will need to be followed closely as an outpatient as well as
electrolytes. GI. The patient was maintained on a bowel
regimen. LFTs were elevated on admission consistent with right
heart failure versus statin. LFTs trended down on admission.
Hemoglobin and hematocrit remained stable at baseline. The
patient will remain on heparin to Coumadin bridge with Lovenox
bridge as an outpatient if needed. Endocrine: The patient has a
history of poorly controlled diabetes and was maintained on
insulin as an inpatient with sliding scale coverage. History of
hypothyroidism , on Levoxyl. TSH within normal limits. ID: No
acute issues. The patient was treated for asymptomatic
bacteriuria secondary to possible permanent pacemaker placement.
She developed itchiness , which is likely secondary to the
Bactrim. Provided supportive care , the patient should avoid
Bactrim in the future secondary to intolerance. No serious
reactions were observed. Psychiatric: The patient has a history
of depression. She was continued on home medications. FEN: The
patient was maintained on a cardiac diet with sodium and volume
restriction , K mag scales. Nutrition was consulted.
Dermatologic: The patient has a history of HSV , status post
acyclovir treatment. No evidence of further infection. The
patient had pretibial erythema , which derm was consulted for ,
which they felt was consistent with venous stasis. She improved
with steroid cream and compression. The patient was prophylaxed
with Protonix and heparin. The patient was instructed to follow
up with cardiology , weigh herself daily with careful notice to
weight gain reporting to the physician and to returne to the ED
with worsening shortness of breath or chest pain. The patient
was instructed to follow a fluid restricted , low-fat ,
low-cholesterol diet as well as a restricted sodium diet. She
will follow up with her PCP Dr. Kuhnke at 786-179-5001 on
1/4/06 at 2:45. Dr. Yatsko at 051-469-9935 on 3/12/06 at 3:45.
INR will be drawn on 1/1/06 with followup INRs to be drawn
every five days. INRs will be followed by PCP.

albuterol 2 puffs inhaled q.i.d. p.r.n. wheezing , Colace 100 mg
