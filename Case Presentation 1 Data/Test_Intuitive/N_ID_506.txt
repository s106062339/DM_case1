Discharge Date: 6/3/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION AND VENTRICULAR
TACHYCARDIA.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: 1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
2. DIABETES MELLITUS.
3. HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Dersch is a 75 year old male
with a history of myocardial
infarction x2 , status post CABG x3 in 1993 , who was admitted with a
recent event of stable ventricular tachycardia. The patient's
coronary risk factors include age , male gender , positive family
history , history of myocardial infarction , diabetes mellitus , and
hypercholesterolemia. The patient has no history of hypertension
or tobacco use. The patient's history actually began in 1988 when
he had chest pain and ruled in for an anteroseptal myocardial
infarction. In 9/16 , he presented to the emergency room with wide
complex tachycardia requiring electrical cardioversion at the
Joadi Community Hospital .  During the admission in 1998 , the
patient had a catheterization which revealed proximal LAD
occlusion , an occluded proximal descending artery off his right
coronary artery , normal hemodynamics , anteroseptal hypokinesis ,
inferior hypokinesis , apical thrombus , and aneurysm with an EF of
50%. An EP study revealed 27 and 22 beat runs of nonsustained
V-tach with left bundle branch block inducible after three
ventricular extra stimuli during ventricular drive pacing at 400
msec. The ventricular tachycardia was initially suppressed with
quinidine , but the patient subsequently developed nausea and
vomiting , and the quinidine was switched to aconine. The
patient did well on this regimen until 3/13 , when he developed
dyspnea on exertion , no chest pain , PND , and orthopnea. In 1/16 ,
the patient had an exercise tolerance test , which she failed
secondary to fatigue. During this ETT , his blood pressure actually
fell from 125 to 85 systolic and his EKG revealed 1 mm ST
depression in the limb leads. Therefore , on 8/5/93 , he was
admitted to the Eredrens Recraw University Of Medical Center and underwent cardiac
catheterization , which revealed 100% LAD and RCA occlusion , 60%
proximal ramus stenosis , and left ventriculogram revealed anterior
hypokinesis , inferior hypokinesis , and apical dyskinesis with an
ejection fraction of 48%. The decision was then made during his
1/16 admission to proceed with surgical revascularization. During
his admission , he underwent a three vessel coronary artery bypass
graft with LIMA to the LAD , saphenous vein graft to the right
coronary artery and proximal descending artery , with endarterectomy
to the proximal descending artery. The patient also underwent an
EP study , and it was found that his sustained ventricular was no
longer inducible either at baseline or during isoproterenol
infusion. Since 1993 , the patient has been doing well up until the
day of admission on 3/1 .
On the day of admission , the patient developed light-headedness and
palpitations while using the toilet. The patient denied any chest
pain , dyspnea , nausea or vomiting at the time. EMS was notified ,
and the patient was found to be in V-tach. The patient was taken
to an outside hospital and cardioverted at 100 joules after failing
attempted pharmacologic conversion with Lidocaine , adenosine , and
amiodarone. The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm and was
transferred to the Villecam Medical Center for further evaluation
and possible placement of AICD.
On his admission , the patient was without complaints except for
some mild lower abdominal pain , which the patient attributed to his
known constipation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: CABG in 1993 , details noted above.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies use of tobacco , alcohol , or
drugs. The patient is currently retired and
living at home with his wife.

140/80 , respiratory rate 16-18 , oxygen
saturation 98% on two liters. GENERAL: This is a very pleasant
male , who is sitting up in bed in no apparent distress. HEART:
Regular rate and rhythm , S1 , S2 were noted , and a I/VI systolic
ejection murmur was noted at the right upper sternal border.
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally with good air movement.
ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender , non-distended , positive bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES: No clubbing , cyanosis , or edema , 2+ pulses noted in
the upper and lower extremities bilaterally. NEURO: No focal
deficits.

epithelials , and crystals.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm since
his transfer from the outside hospital. The
patient had a catheterization , which revealed notable persistent
native vessel disease with patent bypass graft x3. The patient was
started on captopril , which was eventually increased to a dose of
25 mg t.i.d. , which he tolerated well. The patient had an AICD
placed by the EP service with pacer leads confirmed in good
position. The patient did experience one approximately 10 beat run
of V-tach , which did not trigger the AICD to fire. The patient did
experience some mild lower abdominal and low back pain during his
admission , which was relieved with Ultram , and on the day of
discharge had resolved. The patient had been able to take better
p.o. and ambulate.
