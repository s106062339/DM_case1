p.o. q.day , Lasix 120 mg p.o. b.i.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: No tobacco or alcohol use reported.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 98 , blood pressure 128/70 ,
pulse 75. Obese middle aged female in no
acute distress. HEENT was atraumatic , normocephalic. Neck was
supple with no bruits. Lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally. Cardiovascular exam showed distant heart sounds ,
irregularly irregular. Abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended ,
morbid obesity. Normal active bowel sounds. Extremities showed a
healing right shin superficial wound , 1+ edema bilaterally.
Neurologic exam showed mental status , orientation , attention and
language intact. Speech was low , but not clearly hoarse. Cranial
nerves right pupil irregular but reacts 2.5 to 2. Left pupil
irregular status post iridectomy. Visual fields intact. Right eye
slightly adducted at rest without diplopia. Mild decreased
abduction and adduction on the right without diplopia , even on
extreme gaze. No nystagmus. Unable to converge fully with the
right eye. No facial droop. Cranial nerves otherwise intact. Gag
present. Able to swallow without difficulty. Motor showed normal
tone and power to confrontation , symmetric bulk , ? slight slowing.
No clear pronator drift. Tendon reflexes trace brachialis , 2+
biceps , no triceps , trace knee reflexes , no ankle jerks. Equivocal
toes bilaterally. Sensation is notable for decreased vibration
sense , left greater than right at the toes , intact position sense
symmetric. Symmetric exam to temperature and light touch. ?
cerebellar exam with mild dysmetria on finger to nose on the left ,
Romberg stable with slight swaying to the left. Gait slow with
small steps , but fairly steady.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Labs showed sodium 143 , potassium 4.6 ,
chloride 100 , bicarb 29 , BUN 19 ,
creatinine 1.1 , glucose 67 , white blood cell count 8 , hematocrit
36 , platelets 222 , PT 17 , INR 2.3 , PTT 32. EKG showed atrial
fibrillation with no acute changes noted. Chest x-ray showed mild
cardiomegaly , no congestive heart failure or infiltrate. Head CT
showed movement artifact with no obvious CVA , ? hypodensity in the
right upper pons but likely artifact.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with symptoms of
vertical diplopia and unsteadiness/imbalance ,
falling to the left , with improvement overnight. Patient still had
an abduction defect with her right eye on the morning after
admission and mild leftward gait unsteadiness , but her vertical
diplopia had resolved. The patient was continued to be monitored.
Her blood pressure was followed. Patient was kept on Coumadin.
Patient was scheduled for an open air MRI , given her significant
size. Patient was scheduled for an open MRI at the MRI in
Well Deh Ny On 3 of August , patient underwent MRI with particular
interest in visualization of the posterior fossa. No acute infarct
or hemorrhage was noted on MRI MRA. The patient was continued on
her Coumadin. Coumadin had been increased from admission dose of
17 mg to 18 mg p.o. q.p.m. Initially , her INR went down slightly
on 3 of August to 1.7 , likely secondary to a missed dose earlier in the
week. On 17 of July , patient reported feeling back to her baseline of
one week ago. Patient denied any new symptoms. Patient denied
further imbalance or vertical diplopia. Patient was thought to
have had a likely small vessel cerebral infarct and , although no
stroke was demonstrated on MRI , involvement of patient's left side
suggested a cerebral lesion in the brain stem in order to explain
the diplopia. Patient probably had a very small vessel stroke/TIA.
Patient has known major risk factors for both small vessel and
large vessel and cardioembolic disease. Patient was discharged to
continue further risk factor modification in the outpatient clinic.
Patient is to continue her cardiac medical regimen. Patient will
continue with Coumadin for a goal INR of 2-3 for her chronic atrial
fibrillation. Patient was discharged on 5 of March She was
instructed to call SMER COMMUNITY HOSPITAL on Monday morning to schedule an
appointment with her primary care physician within the next 10
days. Patient is discharged in stable condition.
