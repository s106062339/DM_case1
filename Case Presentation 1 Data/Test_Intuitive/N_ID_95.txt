Discharge Date: 1/4/2005
ATTENDING: CASTONGVAY , JERALD M.D.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
Change in mental status.
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS:
Urinary tract infection , hypertension , diabetes , and coronary
artery disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is an 83-year-old female with history of insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus , hypertension , pulmonary carcinoid , and
coronary artery disease who presented with weakness and a change
in mental status. Her son found her at home on the floor. The
patient stated that she fell secondary to weakness. Her weakness
and change in mental status had lasted approximately one week.
She also complained of dysuria. No chest pain , no shortness of
breath , no nausea , vomiting , or diarrhea. At baseline , the
patient is alert and oriented x3. She lives alone and functions
independently. In the emergency room , a CAT scan of the head was
negative for acute process. Troponin was 0.2 , and therefore she
was started on IV heparin.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
Temperature 97.1 , heart rate 78 , blood pressure 190/82 ,
respiratory rate 18 , and oxygen 99% on room air. General: The
patient was in no acute distress , alert , and oriented only x1 to
person. HEENT: NC/AT. Neck: Supple. Cardiovascular: Normal
S1 , S2. Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs , rubs , or gallops.
Lungs were clear bilaterally. Abdomen was soft , nontender , and
nondistended , positive for bowel sounds. Extremities: No edema
or cyanosis: Neuro exam: Strength was equal bilaterally , but
weak 3/5 throughout. Sensation was intact throughout. Cranial
nerves III through XII were grossly intact.
LABORATORY DATA:
Labs on admission showed a white blood cell count of 12.3 ,
hematocrit was 36.4 , CK of 3499 , and troponin of 0.2. Her EKG
was normal sinus rhythm , new 1 mm ST depression in leads II , III ,
and aVF. Her chest x-ray showed right lower lobe mass , which was
unchanged from her previous x-ray. Her head CT was negative.
Urinalysis on admission showed too numerous to count white blood
cells , plus nitrates , and plus leukocyte esterase.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
This is an 83-year-old with diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and
medically managed b.i.d. who is admitted with change mental
status and fall secondary to weakness.
1. Infectious disease: The patient was found to have a UTI ,
which is likely the reason for confusion and weakness. She was
started on ciprofloxacin. Urine cultures were sent and grew
Klebsiella and Citrobacter , which were indeed sensitive to
ciprofloxacin and she was continued on the ciprofloxacin.
2. Cardiovascular: Ischemia. She had a troponin leak on
admission of 0.2. A B set of cardiac enzymes was negative for , the
troponin level was less than assay. The leak was most likely secondary to
demand ischemia in the setting of an infection. A C set of her cardiac enzymes
was negative as well. The heparin was therefore discontinued. The
patient does have a history of coronary artery disease , but is
not a candidate for catheterization per her primary care doctor's
notes. In-house , she was continued on aspirin , statin and a
beta-blocker , which was changed during her admission from
Lopressor to labetalol for alpha blocking activity as her blood
pressure remained high and blood pressure optimization was
attempted. Norvasc was also increased to 10 mg daily and
hydralazine was given p.r.n. for blood pressure greater than 140 ,
for which she received a few doses. She was also continued on
lisinopril and Diovan and she was monitored on telemetry. The
only event on telemetry being a short run of SVT.
3. Neurologic: The patient's change in mental status was likely
related to urinary tract infection. The head CT on admission was
negative. Her neuro exam was not suggestive of any focal
deficits. Her Detrol was held during the admission due to its
effect on mental status. Her weakness was likely due to
deconditioning. She was very weak and had trouble sitting at the
edge of the bed or transferring to a chair with physical therapy.
She was seen by physical therapy who recommended rehabilitation
and 24-hour supervision. The family refused transfer to a
Skilled Nursing Facility despite the recommendation and they
understood the concern and risks. They reportedly planned to
supervise the patient on their own , 24 hours everyday.
4. Endocrine: The patient has diabetes mellitus , her blood
sugars were low on admission. Originally , her NPH dose was cut
in half. Her blood sugars were monitored and remained quite low.
Therefore , her evening NPH was halved again to 5 units at
bedtime. Her appetite remained fair during the admission , but not
great.
5. Prophylaxis: She received Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis.
CODE STATUS:
DNR/DNI was instituted after lengthy discussions with the
patient's family.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. See the primary care doctor within two weeks.
2. Discuss with your PCP when and if you should resume Detrol.
3. Return to the emergency room if you experience fevers ,
worsening confusion , chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea ,
vomiting , diarrhea , or other concerns.

No restrictions.
ACTIVITY:
Bed to chair transfers with assistance and supervision and other
instructions per home physical therapy.
