Discharge Date: 4/18/1999
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 70 year old female with a
history of coronary artery disease ,
hypertension , type II diabetes mellitus , and peripheral vascular
disease who is status post a PTCA/stent of obtuse marginal 1 in
July of 1990 which restenosed and required rotablation and
restenting in January of 1998 who presents now with unstable angina.
The patient had increasing chest pain over the past month
progressing to pain at rest. The patient presented with substernal
chest pain to the emergency room department with a blood pressure
of 230/90. The patient's blood pressure was controlled with IV
Lopressor and the patient was admitted for rule out myocardial
infarction. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on
5/18/99 which revealed the following: A stent restenosis of left
circumflex artery , a 60 percent left anterior descending artery
stenosis , a 70 percent diagonal ostial stenosis , a 40 percent
ostial right coronary artery stenosis , and 95 percent ostial
posterior descending artery stenosis. No myocardial infarction was
noted and ejection fraction was approximately 50 percent
calculated. The patient was subsequently scheduled for coronary
artery bypass graft.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease. Hypertension.
Congestive heart failure. Type II diabetes
mellitus requiring insulin. Peripheral vascular disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Left lower extremity revascularization.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Spanish-speaking female. HEENT:
Unremarkable. Carotid pulses 1 plus
bilaterally with no bruits. Lungs clear to auscultation
bilaterally. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs.
Abdomen: Soft , nontender , nondistended. Firm to palpation in both
lower quadrants in area of lower midline scar. Extremities:
Tenderness to palpation in bilateral lower extremities which was
diffuse and nonspecific. Peripheral pulses revealed 1 plus
dorsalis pedis pulse and 1 plus posterior tibial pulse on right
lower extremity and 2 plus dorsalis pedis pulse and 2 plus
posterior tibial pulse on left lower extremity with 1 plus edema
bilaterally. Neurologic: The patient was conscious and alert and
oriented times three with no deficits.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.7 , BUN 18 , creatinine
1.0 , glucose 205. WBC 12 , hematocrit 37 , INR
0.1. ECG revealed normal sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-T wave
changes.
MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg q.d. , Atenolol 125 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
Captopril 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Colace , Axid 150 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , Amlodipine 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Imdur 120 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
and insulin NPH 22 units q.a.m. and regular 10 units q.a.m.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin- rash.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On 8/17/99 the patient was brought to the
operating room and underwent a coronary artery
bypass graft times three with a left internal mammary artery to the
left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal and saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery.
After surgery the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit in stable condition. On postoperative day #1 the patient was
extubated without incident.
On postoperative day #2 the patient experienced a period of atrial
fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response and rates in the
150s. The patient was treated with IV Lopressor and Diltiazem drip
at 10 mg/hr. The patient subsequently converted spontaneously to
normal sinus rhythm. Postoperatively the patient continued to
experience hypertension with systolic blood pressures ranging from
160s to 190s. The patient was started back on Lopressor and
Captopril and gradually increased to preoperative doses. The
patient was also started back on Amlodipine for further blood
pressure control. The patient continued to experience brief
episodes of atrial fibrillation with spontaneous conversion to
normal sinus rhythm. The patient was followed by her cardiologist
postoperatively , Dr. Grunow . The patient was started on
anticoagulation with Coumadin. The patient's atrial fibrillation
continued to decrease in frequency and duration and , at the time of
discharge , the patient had been in normal sinus rhythm for greater
than 24 hours. The patient was seen by physical therapy service
and it was felt that the patient would benefit from rehabilitation.
The patient is scheduled to be discharged on postoperative day #8
to rehabilitation facility in stable condition with all wounds
clean and dry.
On day of discharge her sodium is 137 , potassium 3.9 , BUN 16 ,
creatinine 0.9 , glucose 163. WBC 16.7 , hematocrit 31 , platelet
count 340 , INR 2.3.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 125 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
Captopril 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o.
t.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , insulin 22 units NPH subcu q.a.m.
and 10 units regular subcu q.a.m. , CZI regular insulin sliding
scale , Percocet 1 to 2 tablets p.o. q3 - 4h p.r.n. pain , Zantac 150
mg p.o. b.i.d. , Coumadin dosed to INR of 2 to 2.5 , and Amlodipine 5
mg p.o. q.d. FOLLOWUP: The patient is to follow-up in six weeks
with cardiac surgeon , Dr. Standrew , with primary care physician , Dr.
Birdsong , in one to two weeks , and with cardiologist , Dr. Shelko ,
in one to two weeks. The patient was discharged to the Faithhugh Lowe County Memorial Hospital .
