DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: ( 1 ) CHOLOLITHIASIS. ( 2 ) CORONARY ARTERY
DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Cocker is a 68-year-old Spanish
speaking man with a known history of
coronary artery disease , who was in his usual state of health until
August , 1999 when he began to developed right upper quadrant pain ,
and was seen by his primary care physician and sent to the
emergency room with a diagnosis of possible early acute
cholecystitis. The patient was admitted to the Surgical Service at
Xole Medical Center , but managed medically without a
operative procedure with antibiotics including ampicillin ,
gentamicin , and Flagyl. The quality of the patient's right upper
quadrant pain was noted as sharp and constant with nausea but no
vomiting , fevers , chills , back pain , or urinary symptoms. The pain
lasted several hours postprandially and had no radiation. In
addition , the patient denies chest pain or shortness of breath.

30 , BUN 15 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose 247. WBC at
11.2 , hematocrit 41.2 , platelets 258. ALT 122 , AST 172 , alkaline
phosphatase 211 , total bilirubin 0.7 , direct bilirubin 0.2.

was negative.
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm at 62
with no signs of acute ischemia.
Chest x-ray is clear.
HOSPITAL COURSE ( by system ): ( 1 ) Gastrointestinal: The patient
was admitted to the Surgical Service
for , likely , cholecystis , and managed medically. He was made
n.p.o. , and hydrated with intravenous fluids and started on triple
antibiotics including ampicillin , gentamicin , and Flagyl. The
patient remained afebrile with a normal white blood count
throughout his hospital course on the Surgical Service. However ,
his alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin became elevated and
the Gastroenterology Medical Service was consulted for
consideration of ERCP. The patient then underwent ERCP on March , 1999 , where a distal common bile duct stone was noted , and an
attempt at removal of the stone was made. However , the stone could
not be extracted. Therefore , the procedure was aborted , and the
patient was transferred to the Medical Service for further
management. The patient's liver function tests remained stable
after the attempt of the common bile duct stone removal , and he
continued to remain pain free and afebrile. Given the observation
of a common bile duct stone , the GI Service thought it appropriate
to take the patient back for repeat ERCP two days later. Repeat
ERCP showed that there was no residual stone , and no additional
stones were noted. The patient was then advanced on his
diet , which he tolerated with no further symptoms. The patient
continued to be followed by the Surgical Service who recommended ,
then , an elective cholecystectomy as an outpatient at a later date.
( 2 ) Cardiovascular: Given the patient's history of coronary artery
disease , a cardiology consult was obtained by the Surgical Service ,
who then continued to follow the patient once he was transferred to
the Medical Service. Preoperative evaluation for possible
cholecystectomy was performed , and it was noted that the patient's
coronary artery disease included the following history: The
patient had a coronary catheterization in 1995 , which revealed a 30
percent left anterior descending artery , proximal as well as mid
stenosis , as well clean circumflex , 70 to 90 percent obtuse
marginal lesion , and a 40 percent , 40 percent , and 70 percent
serial right coronary artery lesions , as well as a 70 percent
posterior descending artery lesion. At that time , obtuse marginal
angioplasty was performed. An left ventriculogram revealed an
ejection fraction of 69 percent at the time. In January 1996 , the
patient had an exercise tolerance test , in which the patient went
six minutes and 30 seconds with 1 millimeter ST depressions , which
were highly predictive of ischemia , but the patient had no
symptoms , and he refused intervention at that time.
The cardiology consult concluded that given the patient's history
of coronary artery disease , a recommendation was made to perform a
nuclear imaging study to assess the patient's ischemic risk for a
cholecystectomy. An exercise tolerance test MIBI was performed , in
which the patient had a good work load. However , moderate to
severe inferoapical ischemia was noted on MIBI images. Given the
urgent need for ERCP during this hospital course , catheterization
was postponed , and the patient remained chest pain free and symptom
free throughout his hospital course from a cardiology perspective.
He was continued on medications , which included Lopressor ,
lisinopril , and Diltiazem. Persistent hypertension was controlled
by increasing the dose of beta blocker with good response. Aspirin
was held secondary to consideration of ERCP and the possibility of
gastrointestinal bleed. Given that the patient remained symptom
free from a cardiac standpoint , cardiology consult decided that the
patient's cardiac catheterization would be deferred until after
this hospitalization , in light of the possible complications of
adding a TB3A antagonist during percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty in the context of possible ERCP. Therefore , the
patient will be followed up in cardiology for elective
catheterization.
( 3 ) Endocrine: The patient's diabetes was well controlled with his
insulin regimen , which was held while he was n.p.o. , as well as on
an insulin sliding scale.
( 4 ) Infectious disease: The patient remained afebrile throughout
his hospital course , but was continued on ampicillin , gentamicin ,
and Flagly per surgery recommendations.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: ( 1 ) Aspirin 325 milligrams p.o. q.d.
( 2 ) NPH insulin subcutaneous 50 units
