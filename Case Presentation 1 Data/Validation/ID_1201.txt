Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: ROSARIO FREDERIC CYPRESS MD
SERVICE: Cardiac Surgery.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 66-year-old male
who was being worked up for other surgery and during preoperative
testing he was noted to have an abnormal EKG. This prompted a
cardiac stress test , which was abnormal. He therefore received
additional cardiac workup and was found to have coronary artery
disease. He does have a history of atrial fibrillation in the
past , but reports that he has not had any symptoms prior to his
initially planned shoulder surgery. He therefore presented for
CABG rather than having shoulder surgery.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Diabetes.
3. Hyperlipidemia.
4. COPD.
5. BPH.
6. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
7. Nephrolithiasis.
8. Impotence.
9. Bursitis.
10. Non-allergic rhinitis.
11. History of hepatitis in 1960.
12. Constipation.
13. Right-sided renal artery stenosis.
14. Renal insufficiency.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Left rotator cuff repair in 1991.
2. Tonsillectomy.
3. Thumb surgery in childhood.
FAMILY HISTORY: No history of coronary artery disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a history of smoking. He also
drinks approximately 2 beers per month.
ALLERGIES: Procainamide , which causes diarrhea and arthralgia ,
also verapamil , which can cause constipation.
MEDICATIONS UPON ADMISSION:
1. Toprol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Propafenone 150 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Rhinocort Aqua 32 mcg q.d.
6. Simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Metformin 500 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Glyburide 5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon admission , height 5 feet 10 inches ,
weight 102 kg , heart rate of 54 , blood pressure 130/88 in the
right arm and 142/88 in the left arm. HEENT: Pupils equal ,
round , and reactive to light. Extraocular movements are intact.
Mucous membranes are moist. Oropharynx is clear. There are no
carotid bruits. Dentition is without evidence of infection.
Chest is free of incisions. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and
rhythm. There are no murmurs. Pulses: Carotid , radial ,
femoral , dorsalis pedis , and posterior tibialis pulses are all 2+
bilaterally. Allen's test in the left upper extremity was normal
with using a pulse oximeter. Respiratory: The patient has clear
breath sounds bilaterally. Abdomen: There are no incisions.
Abdomen is soft , nontender , and nondistended with normoactive
bowel sounds. Extremities: Are free of scarring , varicosities
or edema. Neurologic: The patient is alert and oriented. He
has no focal deficits.
LABS UPON ADMISSION: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 105 ,
bicarbonate 28 , BUN 18 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 178 , magnesium 2 ,
white count 8 , hematocrit 38.5 , hemoglobin 13.6 , platelets 163 ,
PT 16 , INR 1.3 , PTT 34.9. Urinalysis is normal. Cardiac
catheterization done on 8/28/04 revealed a 90% ostial LAD
lesion , 70% ostial ramus , 90% mid D1 , 80% ostial D3 , 75% proximal
circumflex , 50% ostial RCA , 90% proximal PDA. There was right
dominant circulation and 75%-80% right renal artery stenosis. He
had an ejection fraction of approximately 60%.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to hospital on
4/25/04 and was taken to the operating room on 10/19/04 where he
received a five-vessel CABG in which the left internal mammary
artery was sewn to the LAD. Saphenous vein graft 1 to first
diagonal artery. Right internal mammary artery was sewn to the
ramus. The left radial artery was harvested and sewn to LVB2 and
LVB1. Bypass time was 159 minutes. Cross clamp time 111
minutes. Postoperatively , he was taken to the cardiac intensive
care unit where he was hemodynamically stable. He was rapidly
weaned of the ventilator without problems. He did develop a bout
of rapid atrial fibrillation in the first two days
postoperatively. This was treated by restarting the patient's
propafenone , which he was taken preoperatively for atrial
fibrillation. The patient's other primary issue postoperatively
while in the intensive care unit was an episode of oliguria , near
anuria. A renal consult was obtained at this time. He did
receive a bilateral renal ultrasound , which showed kidneys to be
essentially equal in size with no hydronephrosis. He was started
on low-dose dopamine and once his systolic pressure went back to
his baseline preoperative systolic pressure of approximately 160 ,
he began to make adequate amounts of urine. It was therefore
determined that his renal perfusion is largely pressure dependent
with him requiring a mean pressure of close to 100. He remained
hemodynamically stable. He did have some constipation , which was
treated with an aggressive bowel regimen and subsequently
resolved. He will be transferred out to the cardiac step-down
unit on 9/7/04.
The remainder of this discharge summary will be dictated at the
time of discharge.
