3. Regular insulin. 4. NPH. 5. Metformin. 6.
Valium. 7. Aspirin. 8. Synthroid.
ALLERGIES: PENICILLIN , NOVOCAINE , ALDACTONE which all give hives.
FAMILY HISTORY: Mother with CVA at age 21.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She is a schoolteacher. No alcohol or tobacco

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure 132/84. Heart rate 94.
O2 saturation 93% on 2 liters. Sclerae were
anicteric. The lungs were clear. Heart was tachycardic , regular
with no murmurs , rubs or gallops. Abdomen was with slight
hepatomegaly. Normal bowel sounds with slight right upper quadrant
pain. Lower extremities were without edema.
LABORATORY DATA: CK 336 with an MB of 9.7. Troponin was 8.4.
Chem-7 was normal with a BUN of 8 and a
creatinine of 0.9. Hematocrit was 42. White count was 7.
Platelets 196. EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with left axis
deviation , normal intervals. There were Q-waves inferiorly and
anteriorly with poor R-wave progression and persistent S in V6.
There were slight ST segment increased elevations in V2 of 1 mm and
T-wave inversions in V2 through V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Due to her history of cerebrovascular accident ,
no thrombolysis was attempted. She was admitted
to the Coronary Care Unit and treated overnight with increased
dosages of beta blocker and had intermittent symptoms. She went to
catheterization and was found to have 100% left anterior descending
with right to left collaterals and poor distal flow as well as a
90% mid and 90% distal right coronary artery with significant
vessel tortuosity. The left anterior descending was percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplastied with question of distal
dissection which required stent placement. It led to initial good
result. A wire was passed through the stent , but no balloon could
be passed. There was no proximal stent placed due to poor outflow.
The plan was to return to Catheterization Laboratory to attempt
right coronary artery stenting. However , she subsequently spiked a
temperature to 103 degrees Fahrenheit. She was pan cultured and
her sheaths were removed. No antibiotics were started at that
time. Her urine subsequently grew greater than 100 , 000 E. coli ,
and she was started on levofloxacin with plan for a repeat
catheterization once afebrile x 24 hours. She underwent repeat
catheterization and had percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty of the right coronary artery lesion. She was
transferred to the floor on 3/3 On the night at the procedure ,
she had an episode of desaturation to the mid 80 percent range on
room air. A chest x-ray revealed a question of congestive heart
failure vs. a right upper lobe infiltrate. She had another fever
to 102.2 , and she was pan cultured. Her diuresis was increased at
that time.
On 11/27 , the patient began to show signs of paranoia and
inappropriate behavior , and a psychiatry consultation was obtained.
The patient described visual perception about her room being
smaller and was complaining about changes in her medications
without her being informed. Psychiatry felt that she was delirious
and they recommended getting her family more involved to help
reorient the patient. On 3/15 , the patient was oriented and in her
usual state of mental status according to her cardiologist , Dr.
Greever The patient was demanding to go home at that time. Dr.
Janikowski preferred to have a dobutamine MIBI test performed prior to
her discharge , but it was decided that this could be done at a
later time as an outpatient.

for 5 days. 2. Aspirin 325 mg PO q.d.
3. Atenolol 50 mg PO b.i.d. 4. Synthroid 175 mcg PO q.d. 5.
