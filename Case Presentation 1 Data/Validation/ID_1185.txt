DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Lina is a 72 year old man who
is status post a coronary artery
bypass graft and mitral valve replacement who presents with
recurrent unstable angina. He was admitted to the Cardiology
Service for cardiac catheterization. His history began in l976
when he presented with substernal chest pain and shortness of
breath. In l98l , he experienced an anterior myocardial infarction
and in October of l98l , underwent a three-vessel coronary artery
bypass graft with mitral valve replacement. He did fairly well
with no recurrent symptoms until September of l989 when he presented
with congestive heart failure and ruled out for myocardial
infarction. A thallium exercise treadmill test revealed
inferoapical ischemia and the patient was continued with medical
therapy. He did well until one to two weeks prior to admission
when he developed chest pain which radiated to the left arm and was
persistent for three hours after which time it was treated with
Nitroglycerin at Re Lalakety Wood,rank Hospital and resolved. An exercise
treadmill test was stopped secondary to shortness of breath and
thallium scan revealed inferoapical scarring and septal apical
reperfusion abnormality. The patient subsequently underwent
cardiac catheterization at Dentan Lascrople which
revealed l00% occlusion of his left anterior descending graft and
patent posterior descending artry graft and OM2 graft. His native
vessels were remarkable for significant disease throughout his left
anterior descending , an l00% circumflex lesion at the obtuse
marginal l , l00% proximal obtuse marginal lesion , and l00% right
coronary artery occlusion. Left ventriculogram revealed an
ejection fraction of 0.6 with apical hypokinesis. The patient was
referred to Cardiac Surgery Service for evaluation and coronary
artery bypass grafting was elected. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Remarkable for diet controlled diabetes mellitus , history of an
asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm , and a hiatal hernia.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Inderal , Procardia , Aspirin , Lasix , Pepcid ,
Maalox , Nitrol Paste , and intravenous Heparin. ALLERGIES: No
known drug allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a
longstanding cigarette smoking history which was stopped in l98l.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: As above.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He was a pleasant moderately obese male in
no acute distress. HEAD/NECK: Within
normal limits. CHEST: Clear bilaterally. CARDIAC: Regular rate
and rhythm. ABDOMEN: Benign. EXTREMITIES: Without cyanosis ,
clubbing , or edema with good peripheral pulses.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Electrocardiogram revealed sinus
bradycardia with first degree AV block and
right bundle-branch block.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On July , patient underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting and a left internal mammary
artery was anastomosed to the left anterior descending artery.
The patient tolerated the procedure well. Post-operatively , the
patient developed intermittent rhythm disturbances with several
episodes of ventricular ectopy and bradycardia which were not felt
to be significant enough to warrant further investigation by the
Cardiology Service. The patient developed a blood culture that was
positive for enterobacter and the patient subsequently underwent
placement of a Hickman catheter to receive a four week dose of
Gentamicin and Ceftriaxone. This was well tolerated without
complication.
DISPOSITION: CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Good. The patient is
discharged home and will receive a full course of
four weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy. DISCHARGE
MEDICATIONS: Coumadin , Lopressor , and Pepcid.
