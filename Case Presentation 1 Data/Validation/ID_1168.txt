Discharge Date: 3/5/1994
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. PULMONARY EMBOLUS
2. DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65 year old woman
with dilated cardiomyopathy secondary
to Adriamycin , status post recent admission for increased shortness
of breath and left pleural effusion. He returns now with increased
cough productive of white phlegm and progressive dyspnea on
exertion. The patient has a history of breast carcinoma in 1989 ,
treated with left lumpectomy x 2 and XRT , accompanied by
chemotherapy completed in early 1990. The patient then presented in
July of 1992 with progressive dyspnea on exertion , found to have
an ejection fraction of 17%. She was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy
felt secondary to Adriamycin toxicity. She was then treated with
Digoxin , Lasix , Captopril and Coumadin with good result. She had
subsequent development of SVT with a rapid ventricular rate of
approximately 180. The patient eventually underwent EPEP studies
with therapeutic ablation. Subsequently she had done quite well
until February of 1994 when she presented with mild cough
productive of white phlegm and increasing symptoms of right and
left-sided heart failure. She was treated with increased Lasix and
Digoxin and an empiric course of amoxicillin with little change in
her symptoms. She was then admitted on 8/7 after she was found to
have a large left-sided pleural effusion. The patient underwent
ultrasound guided thoracentesis complicated by a pneumothorax
requiring chest tube placement. Evaluation of the pleural fluid
revealed a transudative effusion with all cultures and cytology
remaining negative. The patient was treated with Ancef for
approximately 7 days while the chest tube was in place and then
discharged on 6/20/94. Since that time the patient has had no
improvement in her symptoms but rather notes increasing cough which
remains productive of white sputum with occasional "specks of red"
and progression of her dyspnea on exertion. She is now unable to
go greater than six steps of stair without significant dyspnea.
This is a significant change from approximately one month ago where
she was able to go two flights without extreme difficulty. She has
stable 3 + pillow orthopnea and pedal edema. Her weight has
increased only slightly recently. She denies any fever , chills ,
sweats , chest discomfort or pleuritic chest pain. She does not
anorexia and malaise without myalgias or arthralgias. PAST MEDICAL
HISTORY: 1. Dilated cardiomyopathy as above. 2. Breast carcinoma
as above. 3. Hypothyroid 4. Depression ALLERGIES: No known drug
allergies. Habits , distant tobacco use , none since 1967 , no ETOH.
MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 0.25 mg q day , Lasix 80 mg q day , Capoten 50
mg t.i.d. , aspirin one per day , Synthroid 2 gr. per day , Tamoxifen
10 mg b.i.d. , Elavil 75 mg q day , K-Dur 1 q day. SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient lives with her boyfriend , she is widowed without
children. She is a semi-retired Accounts Manager. FAMILY HISTORY:
There is no family history of cardiac disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 100.6 , blood pressure 116/65 ,
heart rate is 100 , respiratory rate 18. 02
saturation 90% on room air. The patient is alert , responsive ,
febrile and in no acute distress. Her conjunctiva are clear ,
extraocular movements intact , her oropharynx is clear. She has no
lymphadenopathy. Jugular venous pressure is approximately 8 cm at
30 degrees. Lung examination is remarkable for a few rales at the
left base , decreased breath sounds at the right base with dullness
to percussion. Cardiac examination , regular rate and rhythm with
normal SI , SII , positive SIII. Abdomen is soft and non-tender ,
slightly distended. She has pitting edema almost to the knees
bilaterally. Neurological examination is non focal.
LABORATORY DATA: SMA-7 is notable for a potassium of 5.4 and
creatinine of 1.2 with a BUN of 20. CBC
demonstrated a white count of 14 , hematocrit of 42.9 , platelets
289 , Digoxin level was 1.2. Chest x-ray showed a left pleural
effusion which is unchanged , a new right pleural effusion +-
consolidation. EKG showed sinus rhythm at 98 , left axis deviation ,
normal intervals , low voltage with poor R wave progression , no
significant change compared with 7/24/94.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with a picture of chronic
productive cough , progressive dyspnea with low
grade fevers and increased white blood cell count , in addition to
new opacity on chest x-ray. This clinical picture was felt to be
mostly from a progressive infectious process superimposed on
underlying congestive heart failure versus post-obstructive
infection versus atelectasis with an endobronchial lesion. The
patient was started on empiric course of antibiotics including
cefotaxime and clarithromycin. She was seen in consultation by the
Pulmonary Service which felt that a therapeutic trial of aggressive
diuresis was warranted prior to any more aggressive intervention
such as bronchoscopy or repeat thoracentesis. The patient was thus
treated with aggressive IV diuresis with excellent symptomatic
result. As her symptoms and chest x-ray cleared , it was felt that
a chest CT would be valuable in evaluating her left lower lobe for
possible endobronchial lesion leading to volume loss. She thus
underwent a chest CT on 2/6/94 with demonstration of a large
peripheral , red , right lower lobe opacity , highly suggestive of a
right lower lobe pulmonary infarction. No endobronchial lesions or
lymphadenopathy were noted. Given the patient's history of dilated
cardiomyopathy , off anticoagulation , an extensive discussion of the
chest CT findings with the Chest Radiologist and Pulmonary Consult
Team , it was felt that the patient should be treated empirically
for a pulmonary embolus. She was thus started on IV Heparin with
achievement of therapeutic PTT prior to switching to oral Coumadin
without complications. In addition the patient underwent lower
extremity non-invasives which were negative for deep venous
thrombosis as well as a cardiac echocardiogram which showed no
evidence of RV strain or right ventricular thrombus. Of note , this
echocardiogram again demonstrated moderately large left ventricle
with severely depressed systolic function and an estimated ejection
fraction of 15-20%. Though the possibility that the wedge shaped
opacification seen on CT was due to pneumonia rather than
infarction , it was felt that given the patient's low ejection
fraction she would need to be anticoagulated on this basis alone ,
and thus pulmonary angiogram or VQ scan would not be likely to
alter management. The patient was discharged to home.
