CARDIOLOGY Lo Sy Chebaltpa
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
2. STATUS POST PTCA TIMES TWO.
3. SICK SINUS SYNDROME , STATUS POST PACER
PLACEMENT.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 72 year old woman
with coronary artery disease who
is status post PTCA times two with a sick sinus syndrome , status
post DDD pacemaker , and Hodgkin's disease who presented with
unstable angina. Her cardiac risk factors include hypertension ,
diabetes mellitus , family history , and past smoking history. She
had angina in April 1992 and underwent coronary angiography in
October 1993 which revealed an 80% RCA lesion , 70% OM , 70% mid-LAD ,
and 50% D1. The LV-gram was normal. She had a PTCA to the RCA
lesion with a 30% residual. She had recurrent exertional angina
one month later and a repeat catheterization at that time showed no
change. In February 1993 , she had several episodes of lightheadedness
and syncope which was felt to be secondary to sick sinus
syndrome. A DDD pacemaker was placed. She later had recurrent
chest pain at rest and again went to cardiac catheterization which
showed a 70% mid LAD lesion , 30% RCA , and a normal LV-gram with 75%
ejection fraction. She underwent PTCA to the mid-LAD lesion with a
20% residual. She was then discharged on Lopressor , Procardia , and
Aspirin. In February 1993 , she underwent an ETT , and exercised
4 minutes and 35 seconds on a standard Bruce stopping due to
shortness of breath and fatigue. No ischemic changes were noted.
She has done well until two days prior to admission when she
experienced recurrent angina at rest , and was admitted to
Tionwell Swellmo Hospital where she ruled out for a
myocardial infarction. She was discharged one day prior to
admission and on the day of admission had recurrent angina while
doing housework. She took three Nitroglycerins , and the pain was
relieved. Her primary physician recommended that she be seen in
he Emergency Room.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ( 1 ) Hodgkin's disease in remission , status
post 13 cycles of ABVD chemotherapy. ( 2 )
Sick sinus syndrome , status post DDD pacemaker. ( 3 ) Hypertension.
( 4 ) Peripherovascular disease. ( 5 ) BOOP possibly Bleomycin
toxicity. Pulmonary function tests have shown a restrictive
picture. ( 6 ) Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus. ( 7 ) Status
post hysterectomy. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Nifedipine XL 60 mg
q.d. , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. , Mevacor 20 mg q.d. , Aspirin one
tablet q.d. , Micronase 1.25 mg q.d. , Nitroglycerin sublingually
p.r.n. , Relafen and Trental. ALLERGIES: Compazine causes a
possible dystonia. FAMILY HISTORY: Mother died in her 40's from
diabetes. Father died in his 60's with a myocardial infarction.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives alone in Ra and is former
smoker.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 98.8 , heart rate 68 , blood
pressure 120/70. HEENT: There was no
thyromegaly , no jugular venous distention. Carotids were 2+
bilaterally without bruits. Lungs: Rales were heard at the right
base. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 , and a II/VI
systolic murmur radiating to the axilla. Abdomen: A midline scar
was noted , otherwise soft , nontender , without hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities: 2+ bilateral femoral pulses , dorsalis pedis pulses ,
no edema. Neurological exam: Alert and oriented times three.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 139 , potassium 4.2 , BUN 18 , creatinine
0.8. The first CK was 120. The white blood
count was 6.9 , hematocrit 38.6 , platelets 177. The PT was 13.1 ,
and the PTT was 57.3 ( possibly drawn off a line which had been
hep-flushed ). EKG: Sinus bradycardia at a rate of 59 , left axis
deviation , left ventricular hypertrophy , nonspecific T-wave
abnormalities.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was continued on her Lopressor ,
Aspirin , and Nifedipine. Nitro Paste was added
on admission. On 3/30/93 , she underwent cardiac catheterization
which showed a 30% RCA lesion and a 30% proximal LAD. No other
lesions were seen. Her medications were continued except for
changing her Lopressor to Atenolol 50 mg q.d. She was monitored
over a weekend until she could have an exercise test. She had some
belching during this time , and Propulcid was added to her medical
regimen. On 5/23/93 , the patient underwent a standard Bruce
protocol ETT and went 4 minutes and 30 seconds , stopping due to
shortness of breath and fatigue. There were no EKG changes or
arrhythmias noted during exercise , and there was no evidence of
ischemia. She was therefore discharged in good condition to her
home with followup with her physician , Dr. Terrell Gerst and
her cardiologist , Dr. Galen Zinsmeister
DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Procardia XL 90 mg q.d. ,
Atenolol 50 mg q.d. , Mevacor 20 mg q.d. , Aspirin one
tablet q.d. , Micronase 1.25 mg q.d. , Relafen 500 mg q.a.m. p.r.n.
back pain , and Trental. She will followup with her primary
