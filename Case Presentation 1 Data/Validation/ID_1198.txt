HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61-year-old lady with
known history of coronary artery
disease , who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x three in
1989 , with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior

four months , she experienced chest tightness and dyspnea on
exertion , and during the last month , her fatigue was extreme. The
patient was admitted on 7/22/96 to Missi.ell Hospital where an
echocardiogram revealed low-normal ejection fraction with severe
aortic stenosis and mild aortic insufficiency. Aortic valve area
was calculated on 0.8 square centimeters. Cardiac catheterization ,
performed in the same hospital , revealed an ejection fraction of
66% with normal pulmonary artery pressures , aortic valve area of
0.6 square centimeters , and gradient across the valve of 44 mm
of Hg. Native coronary artery disease showed 70% stenosis of the
left main , occluded left anterior descending , 50% stenosis of the
obtuse marginal , and 70% stenosis of the right coronary arteries.
The graft to the left anterior descending and to to the OM1 were
patent. The saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery was

HOSPITAL COURSE: Due to the significant aortic stenosis and
severity of the symptoms , the patient was

possible coronary artery bypass grafting. The patient underwent

the surgeon was Dr. Theis The immediate postoperative course

postoperative day and transferred to the floor. Further recovery
