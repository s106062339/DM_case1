PROBLEMS BY SYSTEM: 73 yo M w/ NSTEMI , h/o 3VD s/p CABG , transferred
here for re-cath. Pt w/ recent PCI 6/19 and had instent thrombosis of
OM2. Also had CHF exacerbation , Afib w/ RVR at EH . Pt w/ no h/o CP w/
cardiac events , only SOB. So any new SOB should be considered angina
equivalent. --CV:
1. ) [I] -- NSTEMI w/ enzymes trending downward. Cont'd ASA 325 , Zetia ,
Fenofibrate. Changed ARB to Captopril and titrated up to 25 mg tid.
Will DC on PO lisinopril. Titrated BB up to metoprolol 50 qid , then
switched to Toprol 200 qd. Cath on 4/29 showing instent thrombosis
likely 2/2 discontinuing of Plavix. Stent was restented w/ CYPHER DES ,
and pt was started on Integrilin gtt as 18 hours , Heparin stopped. On
Plavix now. Pt should remain on Plavix for likely > 3 months given h/o
instent thrombosis. At the same time should also be careful for bleeding
given on ASA/Coumadin/Plavix.
2. ) [P] -- Last EF 31%. Diuresed > 2L at TVH . Cont'd Lasix ( no gtt ) 40
mg IV then PO bid and pt diuresed well at DAH . Repeat Echo 4/18/06
pending results. Pt's exam , CXR , and sxs all resolved throughout hospital
course. May need aldosterone antagonist given failure.
3. ) [R] -- Afib w/ no RVR. Cont Tele. Has had some pauses up to 4
seconds ( these have not been new -- were noted years ago on holter
monitor ). May need AICD +/- biventricular PPM. This will be done as
outpt by Dr. Howard Geddes Will also get re-eval of LV fxn in 6-8 weeks.
--PULM: Pt w/ severe OSA. Hasn't started CPAP as outpt. Started CPAP as
inpt. Pt tolerated this well. Needs to f/u w/ PCP to get CPAP at home.
--GI:ADA/low Na/low Chol diet. Replete lytes. Mg/Kcl SS. LFTs were
resolving. Likely elevated 2/2 hepatic congestion.
--RENAL: baseline Cr 1.3. given Mucomyst/Bicarb pericath. No h/o CRI.
--ENDO: Held home DM meds , A1C--> 6.4 , started on basal/prandial/SS

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Dear Mr. Rumpf , it was a pleasure taking care of you while you were in
the hospital. As you know , you had a heart attack because your
previous stent was occluded. The interventional cardiologist restented
this vessel in the catheterization lab. Please , it is crucial that you
continue taking your medications as instructed , especially ASPIRIN and
PLAVIX. Please take these medications every day until instructed
otherwise by your doctors. Please weigh yourself daily and keep
records of your weight. If you experience worsening shortness of breath
with exertion or at rest , have chest pain , dizziness , fainting , or
swelling , please call your doctor right away or go to the emergency room.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. ) Titrate Coumadin to goal INR 2-3.
2. ) Pt likely needs CPAP machine at home ( failed sleep study )
3. ) Titrate ACEi ( was previously on ARB ) as tolerated , BB ( now on Toprol
XL 200 , instead of atenolol 25 )
4. ) Likely needs re-eval of LV fxn in 6-8 meeks , AICD/PPM , consider
aldosterone antagonist.
