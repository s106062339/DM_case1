ATTENDING: VANLITH , WARREN JAME MD
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN:
Rodrick Lacher , M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES:
GI bleed , V-fib arrest , status post stent placement and status
post ICD placement , CVA , DM , CAD , GERD , hypertension status post
CABG , status post St. Jude's MVR , hyperlipidemia , memory deficit ,
left-sided weakness and status post evacuation of left subdural
hematoma.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS ( to CCU admission ):
The patient was admitted to IMH on 5/25/06. He had been behaving unlike
himself and was having black tarry stools for two days. The patient was found
to
be guaiac positive. A head CT showed no new lesions but did show
multiple infarcts that were known to be old. On 10/18/06 , the
patient had an EGD showing clot in the distal esophagus. This
clot was removed , and the possible culprit vessel was clipped.
Around midnight on 8/19/06 , the patient became borderline
hypertension for an unclear reason. His hematocrit was
stable. The patient's ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker
were held. Also , the patient's Lasix was
held. On 8/19/06 at around 4:00 a.m. , the patient was
reportedly having fitful sleeping and went to the bathroom. Soon
afterwards , the nurse noticed that the patient was having more
ectopy on telemetry. Soon after 4:30 a.m. , the patient was
either found unresponsive or ventricular fibrillation was seen on
telemetry and a code was called. The rhythm was shown to be
V-fib. Chest compressions were initiated , and the patient was
shocked. Soon thereafter , he had two more shock episodes for
V-fib and was loaded on amiodarone 300 mg IV x1. Soon
thereafter , his V-fib terminated and subsequently , the patient
had an episode of slow PEA treated with atropine , epinephrine ,
calcium and magnesium. Code labs showed a potassium of 3.3. The
patient was intubated. A left femoral line was placed. The
patient was transported to the CCU with stable blood pressure on
neosynephrine. He was easily weaned off neosynephrine. The
patient does not have any history of an arrhythmia.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
The patient's past medical history is significant for:;
1. coronary artery disease status post CABG ( SVG to RCA ) with mitral valve
replacement in 1999. In 2003 , the
patient underwent catheterization for unstable angina. The LAD
and D1 were stented. In 2004 , the patient underwent
catheterization for unstable angina showing restenosis of D1
which was re-stented.
2. Ischemic cardiomyopathy.
3. CVA.
4. Seizure disorder.
5. Subdural hematoma while on Coumadin , status post burr hole
evacuation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
On admission on 10/20/06 , the patient's vital signs were
temperature 98.3 , pulse 86 , blood pressure 122/73 , respiratory
rate 16 , O2 sat 97% on room air. He was not in any acute
distress. He was alert and oriented x3. He was interactive and
appropriate. Skin was normal. HEENT showed an old left-sided
facial droop which was unchanged per patient and the family. The
JVP was 6 cm. There was no lymphadenopathy. The chest was
clear. Cardiac exam showed a mechanical S1 and normal S2 , no
extra sounds or murmurs. Abdominal exam was benign. Extremities
had 2+ pulses without clubbing , cyanosis or edema. Neurological
exam showed a left-sided facial hemiparesis. Otherwise , cranial
nerves II through XII were intact. The patient had 4/5 strength
on the left side , 5/5 strength on the right side. Toes were
downgoing.
ADMISSION LABS:
Labs on admission were notable for a creatinine of 1.7 , glucose
of 237 , hematocrit of 37.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:
10/18/06 , elective inpatient EGD for heme-positive black stool
performed by Dr. Marlin Shigo in the presence of Dr. Val Blache
On 11/16/06 , urgent cardiac cathet1erization for cardiac arrest
performed by Dr. Monte Lenig with stent placement in the
circumflex.
On 4/22/06 , dual chamber ICD placed by Dr. Danni
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
This is a 66-year-old man with coronary artery disease and
mitral valve replacement. He was initially admitted for an upper
GI bleed and was then admitted to the CCU status post V-fib arrest
and found to have NSTEMI. His course in the CCU was as follows:
1. Cardiovascular:
A. Ischemia: NSTEMI. The patient had a troponin elevation
beginning 15 minutes after a code was started , suggesting that the NSTEMI
occurred
and then caused V-fib arrest. The peak troponin was 111.
Cardiac catheterization showed severe 3-4 vessel disease ,
and occlusion of the SVG graft. Two drug-eluting stents were placed
in the left circumflex. The patient was treated with aspirin ,
Plavix , beta-blocker , and ACE. The patient's beta-blocker and
ACE doses were titrated during his hospital stay. The patient
was also taken off of Lipitor briefly due to concern about his
liver function. At discharge , he is being restarted on his
outpatient doses of Lipitor as well as a Fibrate.
B. Pump: The patient had congestive heart failure causing
pulmonary edema. By echo , he had an ejection fraction of 25-30%
with a moderately dilated left ventricle , severe global
hypokinesis with posterior and inferior akinesis. The patient
diuresed well during his CCU stay and on the floor. His I's and
O's were followed. He was net negative , and he was discharged
at a weight of 87 kilos. The patient had an echo to evaluate
for dyssynchrony. This echo did not find significant evidence of
dyssynchrony.
C. Rhythm: The patient had a V-fib arrest and returned to
normal sinus rhythm. He received an amiodarone load as well as
amiodarone 400 mg t.i.d. After he stabilized , the amiodarone was
discontinued after AICD implantation on on 7/1/06. The implantation itself
was uncomplicated though the patient developed hives thought to be due to
administration of prophylactic Ancef. The patient was switched
to vancomycin for prophylaxis , followed by po clindamycin. His allergic
symptoms
resolved with one dose of IV Benadryl.
2. GI: The patient came in with an upper GI bleed. A bleeding
vessel at the GE junction was clipped. The patient had a
transient LFT elevation consistent with shock liver. LFTs were
followed and declined appropriately during his hospitalization
and normalized before discharge. The patient was also maintained
on a proton pump inhibitor during his stay.
3. Hematocrit: The patient was transfused two units of red blood
cells on 4/12/06 and 9/28/06. His hematocrit remained stable therafter. The
patient was taking Lovenox as an
outpatient for protection of his mechanical mitral valve. During
the peri-procedure period for his ICD implantation , the patient
was switched to heparin drip and was maintained on the heparin
drip for four days after device implantation. At that time , he
was restarted on his outpatient regimen of Lovenox 70 mg b.i.d.
4. Neuro: The patient has a history of CVA with a residual left
hemiparesis. These symptoms were stable. The patient was also
seen by the Psychiatry Service to evaluate his memory deficits
and abilities to make decisions. The Psychiatry team recommended
that the patient be followed by Neurology after discharge and
that the patient be considered for a formal neuropsychiatric
testing for evaluation of his neurologic and cognitive deficits.
5. Pulmonary: The patient's pulmonary edema resolved with
diuresis.
6. ID: The patient presented with fever and an elevated white
blood cell count initially and a question of an infiltrate on chest
x-ray. This patient was covered with levofloxacin and Flagyl for
three days empirically for aspiration pneumonia. During
hospitalization , he did have very transient low-grade
temperatures on two other occasions. Cultures including chest
x-ray , urine and blood cultures were negative. The patient was afebrile prior
to discharge. As of the day of
this dictation , C. difficile tests were also negative.
7. Renal: The patient's creatinine was elevated reaching a peak
of 1.9 on 4/12/06 in the setting of his cardiac arrest. The
patient's creatinine normalized and on the day prior to discharge
was 1.2.
8. Nutrition: The patient was evaluated by Speech and Swallow.
Initially , he was put on a puree-thin diet that was advanced to
mechanical soft and thin liquids prior to discharge.
9. Endocrine: The patient is diabetic and was maintained on NPH
22 units b.i.d. and a sliding scale. At the time of discharge ,
the patient's blood sugars were well controlled. He is being
discharged on Lantus 48 units at bedtime ( a light increase over his outpatinet
dose ) as well as a NovoLog sliding scale for coverage during meals.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE:
On the day of discharge , the patient was afebrile. Heart rate
70-80s , blood pressure 90-120/66-70. Oxygen saturation 96-98% on
room air. Weight 87 kilograms. Pertinent labs include a
creatinine of 1.2 , hematocrit of 36. The patient's exam showed
continuing left facial hemiparesis. Lungs were clear. Cardiac
exam was notable for a mechanical S1 , no extra sounds or murmurs.
His abdomen was soft , and the ICD placement site was well healed
without swelling , tenderness or erythema.
