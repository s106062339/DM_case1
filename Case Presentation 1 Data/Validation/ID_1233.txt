Discharge Date: 2/15/1998
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: COMMUNITY ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA.
PROBLEM LIST: 1 ) COMMUNITY ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA.
2 ) HISTORY OF MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
3 ) NON-INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS.
4 ) RECENT DIAGNOSIS OF SLEEP APNEA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65 year-old male
whose past medical history is
significant for myocardial infarction in 1996 without residual
angina , non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , and a recent
diagnosis of sleep apnea. He was in his usual state of health
until three days prior to admission when he began to develop a
cough productive occasionally of yellow sputum , dyspnea on exertion
and temperatures to 102 degrees. One day prior to admission , he
went to his primary healthcare provider where he was diagnosed with
pneumonia and given Erythromycin and Ciprofloxacin without
improvement. The following day , he went back to his primary care
provider and was given cough syrup with Codeine , but without relief
and through the course of that day , he developed increasing
shortness of breath , chills and diaphoresis and so he presented to
the emergency room. In the emergency room , he had a temperature of
100 degrees with room air oxygen saturations between 90% and 95%.
He was cultured and a chest x-ray was taken which showed a right
middle lobe infiltrate and therefore , he was admitted with a
community acquired pneumonia resistant to outpatient management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Temperature 100.1 degrees ,
blood pressure 130/80 , heart rate 60 , oxygen
saturation 99% on three liters nasal cannula. His HEENT
examination was unremarkable. His lung examination revealed
rhonchorous breath sounds throughout with decreased breath sounds
at his bases , right greater than left. He also had diffuse
inspiratory and expiratory wheezes. His cardiac examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 , no murmurs , gallops
or rubs. The abdominal examination was benign. His extremities
revealed no edema. His neurological examination was non-focal.
LABORATORY: His laboratory studies were notable for a chem-7 that
was within normal limits. His CBC revealed a white
blood cell count of 7.3 with a hematocrit of 33.5 and a platelet
count of 130. His EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 60 with left
atrial enlargement. There were no ischemic changes. His chest
x-ray revealed diffuse infiltrates bilaterally with a more focal
area of consolidation in the right middle lobe.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 65 year-old male with diabetes
mellitus , coronary artery disease and sleep apnea
who was admitted with a community acquired pneumonia who had failed
outpatient management. He was initially started on intravenous
Cefuroxime and Azithromycin for likely community acquired bacterial
pathogens and atypical organisms. He was cultured and sputums were
obtained , however no organisms were ever isolated throughout his
hospital course. On hospital day number two , he developed
increasing shortness of breath with oxygen saturations of roughly
86% on six liters. At this time , his lung examination was notable
for marked increase in the inspiratory and expiratory wheezes with
decreased air movements. The rest of his examination at this time
including the cardiac examination was unremarkable. This event was
felt to be bronchospasm due to airway inflammation and he was
treated with numerous Albuterol nebulizers and intravenous Lasix on
which his oxygenation gradually improved to 96% on six liters.
Because of the concern of reactive airway disease and perhaps
worsening pneumonia , he was at this time switched to Legionella
doses of Azithromycin and was started on aggressive nebulizer
treatments. However , at this time , the possibility of flash
pulmonary edema causing cardiac problems was also raised. However ,
it was noted at this time that there was no clear precipitant for
an episode of flash pulmonary edema and that his blood pressure was
at baseline. His heart rate was at 70 and he had not become
obviously fluid overloaded. Nonetheless , he received a cardiac
work-up which concluded that he was being ruled out for a
myocardial infarction and the following day , he received an
echocardiogram which revealed an ejection fraction of 58% with
apical inferior and inferoseptal akinesis. There was no marked
left ventricular hypertrophy. Therefore , it was thought unlikely
that flash pulmonary edema had significantly contributed to his
hypoxia and he was subsequently treated solely for severe community
acquired pneumonia with a large bronchospastic component. He was
therefore continued on Cefuroxime and Azithromycin with gradual
resolution of his fevers and a significant improvement in his air
movement and his pulmonary examination. Two weeks prior to this
admission , he was started on a Prednisone taper and subsequent
underwent marked improvement in his air movement and in the degree
of bronchospasm. Therefore , he was discharged home on the
following medications.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1 ) Biaxin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. times two
day to complete a long course for
atypical coverage. 2 ) Albuterol inhaler 2 puffs q.i.d. p.r.n.
shortness of breath. 3 ) Enteric coated aspirin. 4 ) Glyburide 5
mg p.o. q. day. 5 ) Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. 6 ) Prednisone
taper. 7 ) Timoptic one drop o.u. q. PM. 8 ) Cardura one p.o. q.
day.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged in stable
condition.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to follow-up with his primary care
provider. We have also asked him to follow-up on two
laboratory abnormalities which came back through his
hospitalization and he was noted to have a microcytic anemia and he
had iron studies sent which revealed an iron of 16 and a TIBC of
241. His primary care provider is aware of this and will follow-up
on this as an outpatient.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home.
