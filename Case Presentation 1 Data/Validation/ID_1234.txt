ATTENDING: PAWELEK , BENTON FREDERIC MD
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 64-year-old male
with a history of coronary artery disease , CHF , EF of 15% status
post AVR , history of NSTEMI initially presenting to outside
hospital on 8/19/06 with chief complaint of shortness of breath ,
found to be volume overloaded with a clinical exam and laboratory
findings consistent with heart failure. The patient was found to
have a BNP of 747 as well as a troponin I of 0.43. A repeat echo
at that time revealed an EF of 15% , down from a previous EF of 25
to 35% with a functional aortic valve , moderate-to-severe mitral
insufficiency. A persantine MIBI demonstrated left ventricular
enlargement and three-vessel disease with ischemia in the mid
distal LAD and left circ territory as well as a fixed inferior
wall defect consistent with a right coronary artery infarct. The
patient was diuresed , started on Carvedilol and improved.
Troponins trended down. The patient continued to have frequent
runs of ectopy and SVT. The patient was placed on a heparin drip
and transferred to the Acbroadl Hospital for
catheterization and possible percutaneous intervention. On
admission , the patient reported to be feeling much better , denied
shortness of breath or chest pain. The patient reports
progressive dyspnea on exertion over the past several months ,
inability to lay flat , positive orthopnea and PND , reports
ability to climb two flights of stairs , also reports occasional
palpitations. No fevers , chills , nausea , vomiting , constipation ,
diarrhea , bright red blood per rectum or pedal edema. The
patient reports poor compliance with diabetes management , denies
dietary indiscretion , reports medical compliance.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes coronary artery disease status
post CABG in 1994 , coronary artery disease , CHF , cardiomyopathy ,
non-ST-wave MI , status post aortic valve replacement with St.
Jude's valve , hyperlipidemia , diabetes , anxiety.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Include aspirin 81 , lisinopril 20 ,
Plavix 75 , verapamil 240 sustained release , gemfibrozil 600
b.i.d. , nystatin 500 b.i.d. , Paxil 20 daily , glipizide 10 daily ,
Coumadin 4 prior to admission to outside hospital , Carvedilol
6.25 daily , heparin drip and spironolactone.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient currently uses tobacco. No alcohol
use. The patient is retired , lives with wife in Lin Con , teaches
graduate courses.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient denies a family history of coronary
artery disease , however , there is hypertension and
cerebrovascular disease in his family.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient was afebrile ,
heart rate 58 , BP 124/60 , respiratory rate of 20 , saturating 98%
on 2 L. The patient was in no acute distress , lying flat ,
speaking in full sentences. Mucous membranes moist , oropharynx
clear. JVP 12 with bibasilar crackles , left greater than right
and expiratory wheeze with long , pronounced expiratory phase.
Heart , S1 , S2 , prosthetic S2. No murmurs , gallops or rubs
appreciated. Abdomen soft , nontender and nondistended with
positive bowel sounds. Extremities are without edema. DP
intact. Feet are cool but well perfused. Skin warm , dry and
intact , no rashes. The patient is alert and oriented x3.
LABORATORY DATA: Labs notable for creatinine of 1 , hematocrit of
39.5 , platelets of 113 , cholesterol 157 , triglycerides 76 , HDL
32 , LDL 110 , hemoglobin A1c 6.3 , TSH 1.9. EKG , sinus rhythm ,
left bundle branch block with multiple PVCs , a widened QRS of
duration of 190 milliseconds. Chest x-ray , cardiomegaly
consistent with mild interstitial edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: In summary , this is a 64-year-old male with a
history of coronary artery disease status post CABG and NSTEMI ,
CHF with a known EF of 15% , status post aortic valve replacement ,
presenting through an outside hospital with CHF exacerbation
likely secondary to ischemia.
1. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: No evidence of ongoing ischemia on admission.
Elevated troponin at outside hospital trended down possibly
secondary to NSTEMI prior to admission versus demand. The
patient was continued on aspirin , Plavix , beta-blocker and ACE
inhibitor , which were titrated to effect. The patient was
started on a statin and continued on Niaspan , left heart cath
revealed occluded graft and 2+ aortic insufficiency with 100% LAD
stenosis , 70% diagonal 1 , 90% circumflex , 45% RCA and 100%
effused LIMA graft to circumflex and a 100% effused SVG graft to
LAD. The patient is now status post stenting the OM V1 and LAD.
The patient has remained asymptomatic and shortness of breath has
improved.
Pump: EF 15% on repeat echo with severe MR. The patient was
continued on spironolactone. The patient continued to be
diuresed initially and is now euvolemic. He will need a repeat
echo in three months to evaluate his ejection fraction and
determine the utility of an AICD placement.
Rhythm: We held verapamil secondary to double AV nodal blockade.
However , with the patient's history of widened QRS and multiple
PVCs and SVT , the patient will follow up with EP to assess the
utility of AICD.
2. Respiratory: The patient has no acute issues. Shortness of
breath has improved. Continues to complain of residual shortness
of breath while lying flat on his left side.
3. Renal: Creatinine has been stable at baseline. We will
closely follow status post chat. The patient was pretreated with
bicarbonate and Mucomyst. Creatinine remained stable.
4. GI: LFTs are mildly increased likely secondary to right
heart failure.
5. Heme: The patient's hematocrit was 39 on admission. It
trended down status post cath likely secondary to blood loss
given the long case and hemodilution; however , hematocrit fell to
38 concerning for retroperitoneal bleed. Despite patient
remaining hemodynamically stable and groin without evidence of
hematoma , the patient underwent a CT scan , which was negative.
His hematocrit was stabilized. He was not transfused , as he was
asymptomatic and recently revascularized. The patient was noted
to be guaiac positive without evidence of gross bleeding , thus
will need outpatient follow-up and colonoscopy. The patient
continues his heparin-bridged Coumadin with a goal of INR 2 to 3.
In addition , the patient suffers from long-term
thrombocytopenia. His platelet count was 113 on admission.
Review of records revealed thrombocytopenia on previous admission
to Norpid Memorial Hospital as well as on presentation to outside hospital prior
to heparinization , thus low suspicion for HIT. The patient's
platelet level remained stable. He should consider outpatient
evaluation by Hematology.
6. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes on oral
hypoglycemics , which were discontinued on admission. The patient
was controlled with regular insulin and placed back on his oral
hypoglycemics prior to discontinuing. A1c was within normal
limits.
7. ID: No acute issues.
8. Psych: History of anxiety , on Paxil and Ativan.
9. FEN: The patient was maintained on a cardiac diet.
10. Prophylaxis: The patient was encouraged to stop smoking.
He was maintained on a nicotine patch during his hospital stay ,
which he tolerated well. He will be discharged with a
prescription for the nicotine patch as well.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient is to follow up with PCP and
Cardiology as well as EP. Patient encouraged to check his daily
weights and report a weight increase of more than 2 pounds daily
or 3 pounds a week to his PCP. The patient will also follow up
with INR checks as an outpatient.
DISCHARGE APPOINTMENTS: With his PCP , Dr. Qin , telephone
358-190-7457 , on 10/26/06 at 1:45 , Cardiology with Dr.
Mccoyle at 063-315-1331 on 6/2/06 at 3:15 and with
Electrophysiology , Dr. Kunich on 2/6/06 at 10:20. The patient
should arrange to have his INR drawn on 5/29/06 and follow-up
INRs to be drawn every seven days. INRs will be followed by his
PCP.

1. Aspirin 325 p.o. daily.
