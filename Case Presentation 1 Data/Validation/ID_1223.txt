ATTENDING: PRESTIDGE , TUAN MD
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Ms. Megraw is an 81-year-old female with 5-year history of
known aortic stenosis. She has been followed by serial
echocardiograms. Most recent showed an aortic valve area of 0.7
cm2. She states that she does have some mild shortness of
breath. She was referred to Dr. Chas Devot for aortic valve
replacement.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Hypertension , CVA , diabetes mellitus , hyperlipidemia , COPD ,
status post colon cancer , osteoarthritis , GERD.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
A 10-pack-year cigarette smoking history. She drinks one drink
nightly.
ALLERGIES:
Morphine causes itching.
MEDICATIONS:
Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. daily , Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Advair Diskus
1 puff inhaler b.i.d. , atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. daily , Celebrex
200 mg p.o. b.i.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vital signs , heart rate 64 , blood pressure in the right arm
144/64 , blood pressure in the left arm 144/62. HEENT , right
carotid bruit. Cardiovascular: Irregular rhythm with a harsh 4/6
holosystolic murmur. Peripheral pulses are all 2+ and include
the carotid , radial , femoral , dorsalis pedis , posterior tibial.
Respiratory: Breath sounds clear bilaterally. Extremities are
without scarring , varicosities or edema. Neuro: Alert and
oriented with no focal deficits.
PREOPERATIVE LABS:
Sodium 137 , potassium 4 , chloride 100 , carbon dioxide 30 , BUN 29 ,
creatinine 0.7 , glucose 86 , magnesium 2 , white blood cells 5.50 ,
hematocrit 36.3 , hemoglobin 12.6 , platelets 196 , 000 , PT 12.8 , INR
0.9 , PTT 29.7 , hemoglobin A1c 5.8. Carotid imaging , left
internal carotid artery 25-40% occlusion , right internal carotid
artery , no occlusion. Cardiac catheterization dated 9/26/05 ,
coronary anatomy right dominant circulation with normal coronary
arteries. Echocardiogram on 2/13/04 shows aortic stenosis with
peak gradient 77 mmHg , calculated valve area 0.7 cm2. Mitral
stenosis with peak gradient of 7 mmHg. ECG not recorded. Chest
x-ray on 10/10/05 was read as normal.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Brief operative note , date of surgery 3/25/05. preoperative
diagnosis , aortic stenosis. Postoperative diagnosis aortic
stenosis. Procedure aortic valve replacement with a #21
Carpentier-Edwards magna valve. Bypass time was 59 minutes ,
cross clamp time was 48 minutes. Two atrial wires , one
ventricular wire , one pericardial tube , one retrosternal tube
replaced. Findings , heavily calcified trileaflet aortic valve.
Weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass , she was in complete heart
block. A wires and V wires were placed. After the operation ,
the patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit in
stable condition. While in the cardiac intensive care unit , her
course was complicated by complete heart block immediately
following surgery. At that time , she had to be paced and
developed a junctional rhythm in the 30s. On postoperative day
#2 , she was in sinus rhythm in the 70's with occasionally paced
beats. At that time patient was started on no nodal agents of
any kind. Also , while in the cardiac intensive care unit , it was
found that she had a low hematocrit and was given 1 unit of
packed red blood cells and her hematocrit has been stable since.
On postoperative day 2 , the patient was transferred to the
cardiac step-down unit. While on the cardiac step-down unit ,
course was complicated by the following: As stated previously ,
the patient was on no nodal blockers upon transfer. She
developed rapid atrial fibrillation on postoperative day 3 with
heart rates between 100 and 120. Because her epicardial pacing
wires were functioning appropriately , it was felt that patient
would benefit from a beta-blocker. Lopressor was started and the
patient tolerated this dose of beta-blocker without any
bradycardiac episodes. However , patient continued in and out of
atrial fibrillation for the next two days. On postoperative day
5 , she was started on diltiazem drip. Once the drip was
implemented , she was she converted to normal sinus rhythm. When
the diltiazem drip was discontinued and her beta-blocker was
continued , the patient as of today discharge has been in normal
sinus rhythm for greater than 48 hours. Of note , patient was
subtherapeutic on her INR prior to discharge. Her INR will be
closely followed by Greenau Healt Hospital anticoagulation
clinic.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
She was discharged home in stable condition on the following
medications: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. pain , aspirin 81 mg
p.o. daily , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n. constipation ,
glipizide 2.5 mg p.o. q.a.m. , Niferex 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Toprol
XL 150 mg p.o. daily , Advair Diskus 250/50 1 puff inhaler b.i.d. ,
atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. q. day , Coumadin of which she will
receive 3 mg today.
PLAN:
As stated previously , patient is on Coumadin for her rapid atrial
fibrillation. Goal INR is 2-3. Please draw her INR on 11/28/05
and then daily until therapeutic. Onland Medical Center
anticoagulation clinic will be following her INR. The phone
number is 915-360-5305. The patient is to follow up with Dr.
Swinger , cardiac surgeon in six weeks and Dr. Pfeiffer cardiologist
in two weeks.
