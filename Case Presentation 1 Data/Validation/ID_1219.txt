ATTENDING: BRADLEY ZENI MD
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath , hematuria.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 61-year-old gentleman with
a history of chronic renal insufficiency , elevated ammonia levels
chronically , CAD , ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 40% in
LVH , recently discharged from Longlate General Medical Center on 7/10
and subsequently transferred to Ieu University Medical Center The patient
presents with increased shortness of breath. The prior admission
was related to renal failure and increased encepholopathy ( no
dictated summary available ). The patient reported doing well in
rehab for several days. However , over the past 2-3 days the
patient developed increased shortness of breath , and dyspnea on
exertion with very minimal movement. The patient reports stable
two pillow orthopnea. No upper respiratory symptoms. No fevers ,
chills , nausea or vomiting. The patient without palpitation.
The patient does report that shortness of breath was increased
over past baseline. The patient also notes noted increased
hematuria , although the patient has had a chronic hematuria for
over 1-2 years per patient. The patient does report that he had
a Foley in during the prior admission , and has had increased
hematuria since that discharge. The patient denies chest pain.
The patient was felt to have "crackles" at the rehab , and was
sent to the Ridwill Child for further care. In ED
the patient was afebrile , heart rate of 74 , blood pressure
127/75 , and satting 95% on room air. He was given 80 IV Lasix ,
Percocet and Lactulose for elevated ammonia. Labs were notable
for elevated BNP of 655 , elevated ammonia of 83.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was afebrile with a heart rate
of 82 , blood pressure 132/72 , respiratory rate 94% on room air ,
weight 420 lbs. General: Morbidly obese , speaking in full
sentences. HEENT: Oropharynx clear , anicteric sclerae. Neck:
JVP less than 6 cm though difficult to assess secondary to
habitus. No lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular: RRR , no MRG , no
S3 or S4 appreciated. Lungs: Increased crackles at the bases.
Abdomen: Obese , no obvious liver edge , no fluid wave.
Extremities: Lower extremity edema approximately 2-3+. Skin:
The patient with chronic excoriations on abdomen ( the patient
reports they have been improving over the past year ) , and the
patient also with chronic ulcer/lesions throughout lower legs
bilaterally. Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented x3.
Motor strength someone decreased proximal leg and arms.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 139 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 103 , CO2
26 , BUN 64 , creatinine 4.0 ( baseline creatinine of 3.7 - 3.9 ) ,
albumin 3.4 , white count of 7.1 , hematocrit of 33.5 , platelets of
137 , ( baseline hematocrit usually 32-35 ) , LFTs within normal
limits ( ALT , AST , alk phos , T bili ). First set of ED enzymes
were negative. BNP elevated at 655. Ammonia elevated at 83.
INR 1.2 , PTT 36.
Chest x-ray revealed enlarged central pulmonary arteries which
were suggestive of pulmonary hypertension in this patient with
obstructive sleep apnea , left base subsegmental atelectasis. EKG
first degree AV block , left axis deviation , a left ??anticular??
vesicular block , no ST or T-wave changes. UA with 3+ blood ,
15-20 white blood cells , trace bacterial. Of note , renal
ultrasound on 9/29/03 ( prior admission )I revealed no
hydronephrosis , distended gallbladder with multiple small stones.
ETT MIBI on 9/14/03 stress images only performed revealed small
area of myocardial scar in mid LAD/diagonal territory with
moderate stress induced peri-infarct ischemia. Echo performed
2/25/03 revealed an EF of 45-50% , positive LVH. Inferior and
lateral hypokinesis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Ischemia: The patient with a history of CAD and positive
MIBI in 10/10 The patient with no EKG changes , and also no
chest pain. The patient initially continued on aspirin , beta
blocker and a statin. On 8/25/03 the patient with a troponin
leak ( peak of .84 ) which subsequently trended down. The patient
also had had a prior troponin leak prior to the previously
described MIBI. At that time cardiology was following and
recommended medical management secondary to difficulty with
aggressive intervention in this patient. For this admission ,
cardiology was again consulted and cardiology recommended doing a
repeat MIBI to assess. The MIBI was completed on 3/28/03 and
results are pending at the time of this dictation. Again , very
difficult to perform intervention secondary to habitus.
Continued aspirin , beta blocker and statin. To follow up with
Cardiology for further read of the MIBI test. Pump: The patient
with elevated BNP and some fluid overload. Chest x-ray as
described above ( also a question of small pleural effusion slowly
improved from before ). It was felt that the patient's shortness
of breath could be secondary to increased pulmonary edema. So ,
the patient's Lasix was increased to 80 mg p.o. t.i.d. ( from
b.i.d. dosing ). Prior echo is as described above , revealing an
EF of 45%. The patient did have successful diuresis on the
increased Lasix dosing. On 1/24 the Lasix was lowered back to
b.i.d. dosing since the patient's creatinine began to rise.
Creatinine normalized to patient's baseline on 10/14 At time of
discharge the patient is on a home regimen of Lasix 80 mg p.o.
b.i.d. Rhythm: The patient with a history of VT and the patient
was continued on sotalol , and monitored on telemetry without
alarms.
2. Pulmonary: The patient with shortness of breath increased
over baseline and chest x-ray as described above. Secondary to
the elevated BNP and increased lower extremity edema , the patient
was diuresed as described above. The patient does use BiPAP at
night for obstructive sleep apnea.
3. Endocrine: The patient with diabetes on insulin sliding
scale and a.m. NPH. No ace inhibitor was added secondary to the
significantly elevated creatinine. The patient's NPH was
increased to 10 units q.a.m. secondary to elevated sugars
( resulting in more improved glycemic control ).
4. Renal: The patient with chronic renal insufficiency with a
baseline creatinine of approximately 4. This is likely secondary
to several factors , including diabetes , effects of paraprotein
associated with monoclonal gammopathy ( obesity ). The patient was
continued on Phoslo , Calcitriol and Epogen. The patient also
with increased hematuria , and this was discussed with urology.
Previously extensive urological workup ( including cystoscopy ) was
largely negative but were poor studies secondary to large
habitus. Urology attending was not comfortable with aggressive
intervention at this time , and thought hematuria was likely
secondary to significant BPH ( and associated engorged veins ).
The patient is status post Targis procedure as described above ,
and hematuria secondary to recent Foley trauma from past
admission. The patient to follow up with urology in the future.
A urine cytology was obtained and is pending at this time.
5. GI: The patient with elevated ammonia levels , with normal
LFTs. This has also been worked up in the past according to the
patient which resulted in no clear diagnosis. The patient is too
obese for any abdominal imaging per CT. The patient does have a
history of multiple myeloma which could be the source of elevated
ammonia , versus a hepatic source. Ammonium level was 83. The
patient had no asterixis and had normal mentation while inhouse.
The patient's medication of Lactulose was continued.
6. Heme: The patient with chronic anemia as described in the
lab section. The patient did have an episode of epistaxis that
subsequently resolved , and hematuria as described above , though
also somewhat improved at time of discharge. Hematocrit was
stable throughout this , and there was no need for transfusion.
7. Oncology: The patient with a history of IgA monoclonal
gammopathy status post Cytoxan therapy. The oncologist
attending , Dr. Burrows , who knows the patient felt there was
no need for additional chemo at this time. Previous Cytoxan
therapy has not been significantly effective.
8. Neuro: The patient also complaining of muscle weakness ,
proximal muscles greater than distal muscles. A neurology
consult was called , who felt that this was largely secondary to
deconditioning and secondary to patient's multiple comorbidities ,
this is not likely secondary to a myositis. No further workup
was performed.
PLAN TO DO: The patient to be discharged to rehabilitation for
further care , physical therapy and medical management. The
patient to follow up with Cardiology , PCP and Urology. Continue
wound care dressing changes b.i.d.
