CHIEF COMPLAINT: Syncope.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 66-year-old man with
diabetes , hypertension , obesity and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the
right hip on chemotherapy ( R-CHOP ) , which began on 11/29/06 and
will continue for 18 weeks. He reported no complications from
ischemic chemotherapy. At baseline he cannot bear weight on his
right leg and he devised this complicated system where he shifts
himself down the stairs to the bottom of the steps using his
upper body strength and a family member to assist him. All
during this maneuver he felt unusually short of breath the day of
admission and in the context of breathing heavily began to sweat
and feel lightheaded and then lost consciousness temporarily.
Sister was present and called EMS. On arrival to the emergency
room , he was hypotensive and received IV normal saline as volume
resuscitations. His pressures initially were noted to be in the
70s to 80s systolic and improved to 90 systolic after 4 L of
fluid from the emergency room. The patient was admitted for
syncope. On admission as part of the workup for syncope an
initial set of cardiac enzymes was negative.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical exam , the patient was
afebrile , heart rate in the 90s , blood pressure systolic 100 ,
respirations 20 and O2 sat 94% on room air. Pupils were equal ,
round and reactive to light. There was no cervical
lymphadenopathy. JVP was not visualized due to large neck.
Lungs were clear. The heart was regular. There was an S1 , S2
with a loud and widened split P2 component of the second heart
sound. Abdomen was soft and nontender. The right hip was tender
to palpation. The extremities had 1+ edema bilaterally.
The patient was admitted with a preliminary diagnosis of syncope.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The second set of cardiac enzymes was positive
with a troponin of 2. Echocardiogram the morning following
admission showed a dilated right ventricle consistent with right
ventricular strain. This was followed by a PE protocol CT scan ,
which showed a large saddle embolus. The patient was treated
initially with IV heparin , transitioned to Coumadin and then the
decision was made to try Lovenox therapy for long-term
anticoagulation. Cardiac enzymes normalized. Repeat
echocardiogram showed mild improvement in right heart function.
