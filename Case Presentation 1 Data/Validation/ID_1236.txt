Discharge Date: 7/20/2004
ATTENDING: ELVIS CULBERSON M.D.
DATE OF DISCHARGE: To be determined.
SERVICE: Heart Failure.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Referred by primary care physician for
increased dyspnea on exertion.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 63-year-old male with COPD , CABG ,
ischemic cardiomyopathy , hypertension , CRI , CAD , atrial
fibrillation , distant history of DVT , morbid obesity , presents
with three weeks of increased dyspnea on exertion despite an
increase in his Lasix dose from 80 mg b.i.d. to 200 mg p.o.
b.i.d. He has also had progressive fatigue and somnolence. He
denies PND , orthopnea , chest pain , recently ( one week ago ). He
had productive cough and was started on amoxicillin with some
initial improvement in his energy , but has had a continuous
decline since then. He can do his activities of daily living ,
but he gets shortness of breath when he is wheeling around in his
wheelchair. He went to his primary care physician , Dr. Emil Hattaway who felt that he was volume overloaded and noticed a
desaturation to 81% on room air and admitted him to the Heart
Failure Service for diuresis and optimization.

The following medications have been stopped recently:
1. ACE inhibitor ( for hyperkalemia ).
2. Zocor.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 96.7 , pulse 95 , blood pressure
140/66 , respirations 20 , saturation 83% on room air up to 90% on
2 liters. The patient was in no apparent distress at rest , but
had mild shortness of breath with repositioning. His JVP was 13
to 14 cm. He had crackles bilaterally , one-third of the way up
his lungs. Heart was regular rate and rhythm , 2/7 left upper
sternal border murmur. Abdomen: Obese , nontender , nondistended ,
normoactive bowel sounds. He had a left below the knee
amputation , which was warm and clean. Right leg was fully
intact , but there is severe crusting of the skin of the leg from
the knee down , very swollen right foot with skin intact and no
palpable pulses.
LABORATORIES: Sodium 139 , potassium 5.7 , chloride 101 ,
bicarbonate 30 , BUN 71 , creatinine 1.7 , glucose 125. BNP was
473 , digoxin 0.8 , albumin 3.7. White blood cell count 6.2 ,
hematocrit 39.8 , platelets 122 , 000 , INR 3.0 , PTT 68.9. Chest
x-ray showed small bilateral effusions and enlarged cardiac
silhouette. EKG left bundle-branch block with no peaked T waves ,
normal sinus rhythm , T-wave inversion in I , L , V5 , V6 ( which
represent repolarization abnormality because they are asymmetric ,
consistent with LVH although it does not meet formal LVH
criteria ).
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:
a. Ischemia: The patient had no clear evidence of ischemia , but
given his symptoms , the troponin was checked and that was
negative.
b. Pump: The patient was felt to be volume overloaded. His
admission weight was 130 kg. He was started on IV Lasix for
diuresis and began to diurese well putting out approximately 2 to
3 liters negative per day. He had a right heart catheterization
which showed right atrial pressure 16 , pulmonary artery pressure
of 66/26 with a mean of 42 , mean wedge pressure of 25 suggesting
high left-sided and right-sided filling pressures. Cardiac
output was 7.83 , cardiac index was 3.09 , SVR was 695 , PVR was
174. Therefore , the patient was felt to still be volume
overloaded and was diuresed further. At the time of this
dictation , his weight has dropped to 118 kg from 130 on
admission.
From the perspective of blood pressure , he was started on
hydralazine and Isordil to reduce his afterload and these were
titrated up with the goal systolic blood pressure of less than
120.
c. Rhythm: The patient had atrial fibrillation and he was kept
on Coumadin with a goal INR of 2 to 3 except when he was being
prepped for his right heart cath. He is now being restarted on
Coumadin following the cath with the goal INR of 2 to 3.
2. Pulmonary: The patient seemed to have several possible
causes for his shortness of breath including volume overload and
his underlying COPD and body habitus. An arterial blood gas was
done with 2 liters nasal cannula on 10/11/04 and this showed pH
of 7.28 , CO2 of 76 , oxygen of 67 , and bicarbonate of 37. This is
on 2 liters nasal cannula giving an A-a gradient of 16. Compared
to his prior ABG in January 2003 , which showed pH 7.43 , carbon
dioxide of 52 , and oxygen of 60 with a bicarbonate of 37. This
suggested that the patient was hypoventilating. Therefore , he
was started on BiPAP overnight and he said that his sense of
comfort of breathing improved following BiPAP. At this point , he
will be sent home on home BiPAP.
3. Chest x-ray showed small- to moderate-sized bilateral
effusions , which were confirmed on a chest CT. However , because
the patient was still volume overloaded and seemed to be
improving with diuresis , a pleural tap was not attempted.
4. Dermatological: The patient had severe skin thickening from
his lymphedema. Dermatology was consulted for proper care of his
legs. They were initially concerned that there could have been a
superimposed cellulitis and the patient was initially started on
levofloxacin; however , there do not appear to be significant
clinical evidence of cellulitis and therefore , the levofloxacin
was discontinued after two days. Dermatology made specific
recommendations for care specifically , one-quarter strength
Dakin's soaks b.i.d. moist-to-dry on the legs followed by
betamethasone cream and Lac-Hydrin cream mixture twice a day.
There is also an indurated plaque on the right bridge of the
patient's nose for which Dermatology performed a shave biopsy for
concern of a basal cell carcinoma versus a squamous cell
carcinoma. This showed endophytic squamous proliferation with
atypia although the basal layer was not fully represented. This
was potentially the most superficially portion of a squamous cell
carcinoma and deeper sampling was required for more definitive
diagnosis. Deeper sampling has not yet occurred at this point.
5. Urology: The patient was noted to have a blood-tinged urine
output into his Foley. Initially , this was dark red; however ,
this lightened significantly. There are also some clots evident.
The Foley was removed and the patient was able to urinate on his
own; however , his urine is still tinged with blood although it
appears to have lightened up. Further followup will be required
likely with Urology as an outpatient.
6. Endocrine: The patient has diabetes mellitus , type 2 , which
is well controlled after his recent weight loss. He was
maintained on glipizide and lispro sliding scale.
7. Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency secondary
to his diabetes mellitus. We avoided contrast dye. The
patient's creatinine has not increased during the diuresis
process going from 1.7 on admission to 1.7 on 1/23/04.
The discharge medications and instructions will be dictated as an
addendum at the time of discharge.
