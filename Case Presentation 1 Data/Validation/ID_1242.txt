BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: The patient was brought to the ESIH ED by her daughter with the chief
complaint of left leg pain. They were concerned about the healing of her
left fibula/tibia fracture.
---
HPI: The patient is a 72-year-old woman with CAD s/p CABG , chronic kidney
disease ( declined HD ) , congestive heart failure ( EF 30% ) , HTN , and
hypocalcemia. She has also been hospitalized numerous times in the past
two years for CHF exacerbations in the setting of NSTEMI. She has
preferred not to take any of her prescribed medications despite repeated
discussions about benefits of decreased mortality , prevention of
re-hospitalization , and symptom management. In April 2006 she sustained a
displaced LLE tib/fib fx after banging her leg into her bed while driving
her motorized scooter in her apartment. She has been treated by Dr.
Russel Frausto at PCHCOC . She initally refused surgical repair and was
casted , but subsequent films have shown valgus angulation and poor
healing. She declined surgery ( and was a high-risk surgical candidate
given her multiple comorbidities. On 11/27/06 the cast was removed by
Dr. Malhotra and has been in a walking boot since then. She states that
she has pain of the left midleg that she has treated with Tylenol and
that has limited her ability to try and bear weight.
Her daughter brings her in today because of concern for her mother's left
leg. The air cast was taken off yesterday and since then , she has had
worsening pain of the leg. She has been unable to move it or bear any
wait. There is a valgus deformity. They are requesting orthopedic
evaluation. She denies new numbness/tingling or weakness in the
extremities. She also notes multiple chronic problems including
decreased appetite with 40lb weight loss over the past 4-6 months ,
lethargy , apathy. "I just want to be able to walk again and do the
things I used to like doing." ( Going to the horse track , walking
outside. ) She states that she is NOT depressed but sleeps most of the
day.
The family has discussed these symptoms with her PCP. In the past ,
symptoms have been attributed to her worsening renal failure , cardiac
status in this patient who refuses to take any medications. She has
wanted to remain home yet has had documented discussions with PCP about
the benefits of placement to a nursing home for longterm care. Family is
currently looking into assisted living facilities. She also has
requested DNR/DNI status in the past.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease: s/p IMI and 2-V-CABG , July of 2001
( LIMA>LAD , SVG>PDA. ) Her anginal equivalents are N/V but not CP. She is
followed by a cardiologist , Dr. Trent Cannizzo at CICGH . She is uninterested
in pursuing any additional cardiac evaluation.
2. CHF with EF 26% ( 5/25 ). Mod-Severe MR. Several exacerbations over
past yr. in setting of NSTEMI ( 3/22 )
3. Hypertension.

hemoglobin A1c was less than 6% without medications. Her diabetic
complications include peripheral neuropathy and chronic kidney disease.
5. Chronic kidney disease 2/2 DM with a baseline creatinine of 3.5 to 4.
She has no interest in hemodialysis.
6. Hypocalcemia secondary to chronic kidney disease and profound vitamin
D deficiency with an associated myopathy and bone pain. She also has
severe secondary hyperparathyroidism.
7. History of colon cancer status post a partial colectomy. The patient
has requested no follow-up for this problem.
8. Osteoarthritis status post a left total hip replacement for aseptic
necrosis. Since that time she has a leg length discrepancy and uses
crutches to ambulate until a recent tib/fib fx which has left her
WC-dependent.
9. Chronic anemia secondary to chronic kidney disease. She does have a
history of prior upper GI bleeding secondary to peptic ulcer disease.

_________________________________________
IMPRESSION:
72F with multiple chronic medical problems s/p recent tib/fib fx
( non-surg mgmt ) admitted for evaluation of her fracture. She was admitted
to medicine for "longterm placement." Yet upon interview of the family
they intend for Ms. Pall to go home after this hospital stay. From
there , she will transition to assisted living. Over the last few months ,
she has declined to take any medications or treatment for her chronic
kidney disease or cardiac disease. This has led to progressive renal
disease , electrolyte abnormalities and myopathy. The family brings her
in with concerns regarding her left leg. While they do want to
transition to assisted living , they do not intend to place her directly
from DUOMC to RH or Rehab. They hope she will go home after this hospital
stay and continue with VNA/services.
ORTHO: Tib/fib fracture. Non-surgically managed. Followed by Dr.
Alirez Seen by Orthopedic service who discussed the 2 options:
casting with patellar tendon bearing cast or surgery. As before ,
patient declined surgery ( this decision has been supported by her PCP and
cardiologist as she is a high risk surgical candidate. ) There were no
casting technicians in-house this weekend. Therefore she will followup in
the Orthopedics clinic on Wednesday , as instructed by the ortho resident
on call.
.

supplements such as nephrocaps. Phosphate was wnl despite not taking
phoslo at home.
