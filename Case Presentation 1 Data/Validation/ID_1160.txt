Discharge Date: 6/10/2000
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: PERICARDIAL TAMPONADE.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1 ) SUBACUTE LUNG TRANSPLANT REJECTION.
2 ) BACK PAIN.
3 ) ACUTE TUBULAR NECROSIS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 53 year-old male with
a history of idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis status post left lung transplant in 1996 , hypertension ,
steroid induced type 2 diabetes mellitus , deep venous thrombosis
and pulmonary embolus in 1998 , who was previously admitted to
Reo University Of Of on January , 2000 for pericarditis. The
patient was discharged home on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs , however returned to the hospital on November , 2000
complaining of crushing chest pain , nausea , sweating and shortness
of breath , worse on exertion. On the previous admission , the
patient had an echocardiogram suggestive of a small pericardial
effusion and also perhaps pericarditis. The patient was admitted
to the hospital for further evaluation of his chest pain and to
rule out pericardial tamponade.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Single left lung transplant in October of
1996 for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. 2 )
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis diagnosed in 1994. 3 ) Steroid
induced type 2 diabetes mellitus , myopathy , osteoporosis , gouty
arthropathy. 4 ) Hypertension. 5 ) Thromboembolic disease status
post deep venous thrombosis. 6 ) Esophageal dysmotility. 7 )
Diverticulosis , status post diverticulitis and sigmoid colectomy in
1999. 8 ) Nephrolithiasis , status post temporary ureteral stent.
9 ) Status post appendectomy. 10 ) Chronic obstructive sleep apnea
on C-PAP.
ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to Compazine which causes a
rash and dystonia.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Cyclosporine. 2 ) Prednisone. 3 )
Azathioprine. 4 ) Diltiazem sustained
release. 5 ) Lopressor. 6 ) Glyburide. 7 ) Vomox. 8 ) Oxycontin
p.r.n. pain. 9 ) Calcitriol.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married with three children. He
works as an engineer. He has a 40 year history of
smoking tobacco , approximately 2-3 packs per day. He stopped
smoking in 1994. He occasionally drinks alcohol.
FAMILY HISTORY: His mother and brother have diabetes. His father
has kidney disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Temperature 99.4 degrees ,
heart rate 130-150 , blood pressure
100-120/70-80 , respiratory rate 20 , oxygen saturation 96% on two
liters at rest. Neck was supple , non-tender , no lymphadenopathy ,
no jugular venous distension appreciated. Oropharynx was clear.
Lungs revealed dense rales , decreased breath sounds , bibasilar
egophony with increased fremitus on the right , left lung clear.
Cardiovascular examination was tachycardic with regular rhythm , no
murmurs , gallops or rubs appreciated. Abdomen was obese , positive
bowel sounds , soft , non-tender , non-distended , no
hepatosplenomegaly appreciated. Skin revealed numerous auricular
papules. He also had a circumscribed plaque on his left leg noted
to be old. Neurological examination was grossly intact with a mild
hand tremor.
LABORATORY: Laboratory studies on admission revealed a white blood
cell count of 11.4 , hematocrit 30.5 , platelet count
267. SMA-7 revealed a sodium of 139 , potassium 4.3 , chloride 102 ,
bicarbonate 25 , BUN 34 , creatinine 2.1 , glucose 238. Creatinine
kinase was 12. Troponin I was 0.17. Electrocardiogram on
admission was significant for a supraventricular tachycardia at 140
beats per minute. There were no ST segment elevations and no acute
changes. Chest x-ray was significant for low volume in the right
lung. The left lung was essentially clear. There was no
compression. Echocardiogram on admission was suggestive of
pericardial tamponade.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to General Medical
Service on November , 2000 and taken to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory where he was found to have pericardial
tamponade. Pericardiocentesis was attempted in the catheterization
laboratory on November , 2000 , however it was complicated by right
ventricular puncture. The patient was transferred to the operating
room emergently on November , 2000 for right ventricular puncture
repair and for pericardial window. The patient was followed by the
Surgical Service postoperatively until his cardiac and pulmonary
function were stable. He was transferred back to the Medical
Service on August , 2000 for further evaluation and treatment of
pain and further evaluation of his renal function. Hospital course
by treatment issues as follows: 1 ) Chronic pain: The patient's
pain was felt to be likely due to chronic back conditions and also
pericardial pain. The patient was given narcotics , however became
somnolent requiring Narcan reversal. Pain Service consultation
suggested a regimen of Ultram , Vioxx and Prednisone. The patient
showed improvement on this regimen. In addition , the patient
received steroid trigger point injections with some symptomatic
relief.
2 ) Acute tubular necrosis: On August , 2000 through April ,
2000 , the patient had increase in his creatinine to 2.5 thought to
be of pre-renal etiology secondary to Lasix he had received on the
Surgical Service. He received fluid boluses improving his
creatinine. However , he developed hypernatremic diuresis on September , 2000 through January , 2000 which was thought to be a post
acute trivial necrosis diuresis. He was treated with continuous
intravenous fluids of D5 1/2 normal saline with improvement. By
September , 2000 , his creatinine continued to improve to a level of
1.1 , and the patient's diuresis subsided.
