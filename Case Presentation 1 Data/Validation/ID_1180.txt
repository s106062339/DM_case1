3/6 AS murmur , trace rales , abd? , 3+ pitting LE
edema. Impression: 71yo woman w/CHF , AFib , AS , DM ,
CRI , w/hx of recent CHF exacerbation now p/w with
vol overload , dyspnea , and renal failure. Etiology of CHF exacerbation
unclear:she r/o for MI , no worsening of her afib , no si/sx's of
infection ,
no hx to suggest dietary indiscretion , medical non-compliance , lack of
medications CV:Isch- no evidence of ischemia: pt r/o for MI with
negative enzymes. PUMP: Pt was gently diuresed ~2L/day on Torsemide
100 IV TID x 4 days with excellent response and then switched to her
home diuretic regiment of 100 mg BID of PO torsemide and 5 mg PO
Zaroxolyn on the day prior to discharge still with good diuretic
effect. Her admission wt was 132.9KG and on day of discharge she
weighed 125.8kg: net total loss of 7.1 kg or 15.6 lbs per this admit.
During this admission , strict I/O's , daily weight. fluid
and salt restriction were maintained. She was not re-started on
Cozaar given BP's in low range with SBP:90;s. RHYTHM: chronic afib
w/good rate
control w/o agent and no rate issues during this admission. Pt is not
on coumadin given hx
of GI bleed. Pulm: Pt was continued on her Advair disk , flonase , prn
nebs. She was placed on CPAP @ night and did well with cpap;
arrangements were made for pt to have her CPAP at home changed to
hospital setting and equipment. HEME:1 )ANEMIA
Pt was admitted with HCT of 30.7 , lower then her normal. She had 3
positive stool guiaic's , low normal Fe
studies , and stable HCT during this admission. Her ASA was stopped 2/2
concern for GIB. Pt is scheduled to follow-up with her GI doctor , Dr. Ethan Wasowski 2 days after discharge.2 )THROMBOCYTOPENIA:pt had a drop in
platlets that was initially concerning , but ultimately appeared
to be lab variation with its resolution on the next blood
draw. RENAL:Pt was admitted with acute
on chronic renal failure felt to be secondary to decreased CO. Her CRT
elevation gradually resolved from 2.4 on admission to 1.8 at time of
discharge. Her celebrex was stopped 2/2 ARF.
Proph: Pt was placed on
Heparin 5000u SC BID for DVT prophylaxis and Nexium
40 GI:Pt was noted to have elevated LFT's on admission labs. Her peak
LFT's were ALT:368 , AST: 274 , AP:158 with nl BILIT 0.5 and biliD
0.3. DDX included congestion vs infection vs medications. hepatitis
deemed unlikely but hep panel still pending at time of discharge.
Since pt's LFT's did not resolve with excellent diuresis , it was felt
that it was not likely due to congestion. Most likely etiology was felt
to be reaction to drug. Pt was taken off the following hepatotoxic
meds: tylenol , statin , percocet , allopurinol. She was continued on her
tamoxifen , although case reports of hepatotoxicity noted; other
consideration included the neurontin , but lft's began to normalize on
medication. Pt is scheduled to follow-up with GI , Dr. Hornshaw 2
days following discharge. FEN: Pt's lytes were aggressively repleted;
she required significant K repletion each day and will be d/c'd on K.
She was maintained on a NA and fluid restriction and placed on a
cardiac and diabetic diet. ( ENDO ): DM: Pt was initially placed on RISS
given concern for hypogylcemia and her home regiment was gradually
added to her inpatient regiment with elevated FS.
Pt was stable at time of discharge , sx's much improved , and scheduled f
or follow-up with cardiologist and CHF nurse on 8/28/03.
