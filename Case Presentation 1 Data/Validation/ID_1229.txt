Discharge Date: 10/24/1992
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1 ) DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASE , RIGHT ANKLE
( RIGHT TIBIOTALAR JOINT ) SECONDARY TO
TRAUMATIC ARTHRITIS.
2 ) INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES.
3 ) HYPERTENSION.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: Tibiotalar fusion with cross-cannulated
AO screws times three and local bone
graft performed 1/10/92 by Dr. Tim Fajen
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This 44 year old Phys. Ed. teacher had
a long history of ankle pain on the
right side. He had a fracture as a child which was fixed with an
open reduction and internal fixation. He sustained a second ankle
fracture a number of years later when he fell off a ladder and
refractured his ankle. Currently , he has pain on all movements of
the ankle while walking and performing any activity. The pain is
primarily in the ankle joint but also in his mid foot. He has been
controlling his pain with Darvocet as well as intramuscular Tordal
15 to 30 mg four times a day. He denies any other joint
involvement and he denies any motor or sensory changes. PAST
MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for Insulin dependent diabetes
currently managed with 32 units of NPH Humulin. He also has a
history significant for hypertension. He denies bowel or bladder
dysfunction , he denies coronary artery disease , dysrrhythmia , or
murmur , he denies peptic ulcer disease , and he denies thyroid gland
abnormality. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for fracture
times two of his right ankle status post open reduction and
internal fixation first time in 1965 and second time in 1988 , he
had herniorrhaphy in 1978 , he had drainage of a right thumb abscess
in 1988 , and he has had septicemia treated at Vensperdon Hospital in
February and September of 1991. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: NPH Insulin
32 units every morning , Procardia XL 90 mg q.a.m. , Lotensin 40 mg
p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , potassium supplement , and then
Ketorolac 15-30 mg intramuscularly q.i.d. , and Darvocet N-100 one
to four tablets q.d. ALLERGIES: He has no known drug allergies.
He denies smoking history and he denies ethanol abuse. REVIEW OF
SYSTEMS: Negative for dyspnea on exertion , shortness of breath ,
palpitations , or anginal like symptoms. He does get bilateral leg
edema. He has not had any evidence of neuropathy , retinopathy , or
nephropathies associated with his diabetes.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Well-developed 44 year old male who appears
stated age. HEENT: Demonstrated pupils to
be equal and reactive , extraocular muscles intact , and oropharynx
was clear. NECK: Supple with full painless range of motion and
there was no goiter , adenopathy , or jugular venous distention.
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation. CARDIAC: Demonstrated a regular
rate and rhythm without significant murmur , rub , or thrill.
ABDOMEN: Soft , non-obese , and non-tender without evidence of
hepatosplenomegaly. ORTHOPEDIC: Demonstrated that he had
approximately 10 degrees of dorsiflexion , 10 degrees of plantar
flexion with very limited subtalar motion , good mid foot motion but
with some pain on motion of the mid foot. There was pain during
movement of his tibiotalar joint. Specifically , there was little
pain with motion of the subtalar joint or the mid foot. He had
good dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses , he had normal
sensation at the first dorsal web space , dorsum , and plantar
aspects of the foot , and the hindfoot appeared to be in neutral
position. There did not appear to be any supination or pronation
deformities. He had full painless range of motion at the hip and
at the knee on the ipsilateral side.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: X-Rays demonstrated marked degenerative
joint disease with a complete obliteration
of the articular joint space in the lateral half of the joint.
There were also some degenerative changes in the mid foot. His
pre-operative laboratory evaluation demonstrated EKG with normal
sinus rhythm and no evidence of ischemic changes , glucose was 133 ,
BUN was 35 , creatinine 1.2 , potassium of 4.2 , liver function tests
were entirely within normal limits , hematocrit was 42.8 , white
blood cell count was 9 , and the PT and PTT were 11.6 and 28.2
respectively. The patient's urinalysis was entirely clear for
bacteria and negative for glucose and ketones.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted as a same day surgery
candidate with traumatic arthritis at the right
tibiotalar joint and he underwent tibiotalar fusion with
cross-cannulated AO screws and local bone graft. The procedure
involved partial fibulectomy as well as a partial osteotomy of the
medial malleolus. The position of the ankle at the end of the
procedure was neutral dorsiflexion , plantar flexion , and neutral
varus/valgus. He had a general endotracheal anesthetic for failed
sciatic nerve block , estimated blood loss was 200 cc , and total
tourniquet time was 1 hour and 57 minutes. He received 2500 cc of
crystalloid intraoperatively and he tolerated the procedure well.
Post-operatively , his motor and sensory examinations were intact
with regard to deep and superficial peroneal and posterior tibialis
nerves. His Hemovac put out a total of 150 cc and was removed on
post-operative day number one. He initially was kept in a
posterior splint with anterior wings. This was changed on
post-operative day two. The wound appeared to be clean and dry and
he was placed in a short-leg fiberglass cast since there was little
swelling apparent. He had an X-Ray after placement of the cast and
the position of the ankle looked to be in neutral position and
neutral varus/valgus. He was cleared by Physical Therapy
ambulatory , non-weight bearing , with use of crutches. He did not
have any difficulties with the cast , no significant swelling , and
was discharged on post-operative day three. The patient did have
some elevated temperatures which were attributed to atelectasis and
was encouraged to cough and deep breath.
DISPOSITION: Patient will follow-up with Dr. Norman Dutko in
approximately three weeks at which time the cast will
be changed and stitches removed. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: The
medications that he was admitted on with the addition of Vicodan
one to two p.o. q.3-4h. p.r.n. , Naprosyn 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. as a
substitute for the Tordal , and Halcion 0.125 to 0.25 mg p.o. q.h.s.
