HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a morbidly obese , 53
year old , white male who presented
with new onset chest pain and melena. He had been in his usual
state of good health and was without known cardiac risk factors.
The night prior to the night of admission , while walking from the
bathroom to his bed in the heat , he developed new chest tightness
which he described as somebody sitting on his chest. He had
shortness of breath and diaphoresis but no nausea , vomiting ,
palpitations or radiation. He returned to this bed , and the pain
resolved after several minutes of rest. He was without further
episodes until the night of admission , when walking to work he had
2-3 episodes of chest tightness similar to the night before. Each
of them lasted at most 10-15 minutes. He went to the Mapark Hospital emergency ward for evaluation. He denied any pain
like this previously. He denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or
orthopnea but did have daily ankle swelling for the past five
minutes and some new shortness of breath after walking 200 yards
over the past 5-6 months. He also reported two episodes of black
loose stools , one 2-3 weeks prior to admission and one on the night
of admission. He had some transient abdominal discomfort 2-3 weeks
prior to admission which he treated with ibuprofen 800 mg t.i.d. to
q.i.d. for 3-4 days. He had no recent abdominal pain , nausea ,
vomiting , hematemesis , hematochezia or coffee ground emesis. He
was without history or family history of peptic ulcer disease. He
was without recent weight loss or gain. He has had long time
ingestion of 6-8 beers a day but no recent binges. He took four
Excedrin the day prior to admission for a headache. An NG tube in
the emergency ward showed bilious material which was guaiac
negative. He denied fevers , chills , cough , sputum , dysuria ,
obstructive urinary symptoms , headache , visual changes ,
paresthesias , early satiety or bleeding diatheses. PAST HISTORY:
Chronic nasal congestion; right sciatica. MEDICATIONS ON
ADMISSION: Sudafed p.r.n. ALLERGIES: None known. FAMILY
HISTORY: Mother died of cancer; father died of "heart failure" in
his late 60s. No family history of diabetes mellitus or
hypertension. SOCIAL HISTORY: He smoked four and a half packs of
cigarettes per day times 15 years; quit 15 years ago. He drinks
6-8 beers a day. He lives in Alabama with his wife and three
of his seven adult children. He has three small grandchildren. He
works the night shift as a fork lift operator for the post office.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed a morbidly obese man in no
apparent distress. Pulse 84 and blood
pressure 142/80 lying; pulse 86 and blood pressure 150/100 sitting;
respirations 26; afebrile. The head was normocephalic and
atraumatic. The extraocular muscles were intact; pupils equal ,
round and reactive to light; conjunctivae clear. The oropharynx
was clear. The neck revealed full range of motion; no thyromegaly;
no masses; unable to evaluate JVD secondary to a thick neck. There
was no CVA or spinal tenderness. The chest was clear to
auscultation and percussion; decreased breath sounds throughout;
barrel chest. The cardiovascular exam revealed a nearly inaudible
S1 and S2; no murmurs audible. The abdomen was soft and
protuberant; nontender; normal bowel sounds. The extremities were
without clubbing , cyanosis , clear edema or calf tenderness or
swelling. The neuro exam was nonfocal. The rectal exam revealed
black and maroon guaiac positive stool.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Hematocrit 37.0; white blood cell count
17.2 with 75 polys , 1 band , 18 lymphs , 4
monos , 2 eos; platelets 439 , 000; sodium 136; potassium 4.4;
chloride 104; CO2 23; BUN 60; creatinine 2.0; glucose 168; calcium
10.2; phosphate 3.8; protein 7.3; albumin 4.6; AST 37; ALT 23; LDH
271; alkaline phosphatase 87; cholesterol 210; triglyceride 226;
CPK 72 on admission. The chest x-ray showed fat in the
mediastinum , normal heart , no infiltrate or effusion. A KUB showed
no obstruction or free air. A tagged red blood cell scan in the EW
was negative for bleeding source. The EKG showed a normal sinus
rhythm with a rate of 90; frequent PVCs; intervals 0.15 , 0.07 and
0.39; axis 40 degrees; flipped T wave in L; flat Ts in V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: #1 ) Angina. The patient was admitted with a
story classic for angina. He was admitted for a
rule out MI protocol. His EKG remained essentially unchanged. He
was noted to be in bigeminy and had some frequent PVCs on several
EKGs and on monitor , however , his EKG remained unchanged except for
some labile T waves in the lateral lead which changed with lead
placement. He was ruled out for an MI with CPKs which actually
went up from a CK of 72 to a peak of 331 , but on electrophoresis
there was no MB fraction found. The bump in the CK level was felt
to be secondary to multiple attempts at a central line placement in
the EW and skeletal muscle trauma. He was treated with sliding
scale Nitropaste and nifedipine for blood pressure control in the
hospital. An echocardiogram was done to assess left ventricular
function which revealed no regional wall motion abnormality , some
slight decrease in compliance but good LV function. An exercise
tolerance test could not be completed secondary to his sciatica.
On ETT he went for one minute and 44 seconds with a heart rate of
81-122 , blood pressure 136/80 to 144/80. There were no ST changes
noted. There were some asymptomatic VPBs and no chest pain. He
was discharged on Procardia XL 30 daily and given a prescription
for nitroglycerin and instructed on how to use this. #2 ) GI
bleed. He was admitted with melena and a falling hematocrit. A
hematocrit drawn at EH in January was 48 and on admission here was
37 and dropped to a low of 28. He received three units of packed
red blood cells in the hospital. An endoscopy on 2/6/90 showed
two small ulcers in the prepyloric antrum , one measuring 3 mm and
the other 5-6 mm. Both were superficial and benign appearing at
the time , and neither had stigmata of a recent bleed. Biopsies
were taken with good hemostasis. No varices or esophagitis were
noted. The GI bleed was presumed to be secondary to his ulcer
disease. He was treated during the hospitalization with an H2
blocker which was to continued for 8-12 weeks after discharge. He
was instructed to not take aspirin or nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs or to drink alcohol after discharge. The
discharge hematocrit was approximately 35 and remained stable. #3 )
Leukocytosis. He was noted to have a leukocytosis without bands on
admission. This resolved with hydration and was felt to be most
likely secondary to stress reaction. #4 ) Sleep apnea. He was
noted to be apneic at night by the nurses with sinus bradycardia
and sinus pauses during the apneic episodes. He had one sinus
pause at seven seconds. On the third night of admission , he was
monitored on a sat monitor overnight which noted him to desaturate
to the 60% and 70% range during his apneic episodes. He was
presumed to have sleep apnea and will be worked up as an outpatient
with a sleep study per Dr. Mittleman #5 ) Renal. He had an
increased BUN and creatinine on admission. This decreased with
hydration. The discharge BUN was 23 and creatinine 1.1.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home in stable condition.
COMPLICATIONS: None. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
Pepcid 40 mg p.o. daily; Procardia XL 30 mg p.o. daily;
nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual p.r.n. chest pain. FOLLOW UP will
be with his internist , Dr. Carbonaro , and with Dr. Mirabile in eight
weeks for a repeat endoscopy and with Dr. Cirillo for a sleep study.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. NEW ONSET ANGINA.
2. GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED.
3. SLEEP APNEA.
