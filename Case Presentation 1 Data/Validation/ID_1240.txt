HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 71 year old male with
coronary artery disease status post a
coronary artery bypass graft times two now presenting with chest
pain. He has had anginal type chest pain for years , never
associated with numbness , nausea , or sweating. Usually , they were
about four times a week but three months ago , he began getting pain
four to five times a day not with any exertion. He has had
decreased exercise tolerance. He takes one to four Nitroglycerin
tablets a day. The day of admission , he felt light headed and had
subsequent substernal chest pain. He took two Nitroglycerin with
no relief and called an ambulance where he had Morphine and
Nitroglycerin with relief. This pain was non-radiating but was
associated with nausea and urge to defecate. He was not quite sure
it was same as his inferior myocardial infarction which he had in
1973. In 1980 , he had a coronary artery bypass graft and again in
1982. Catheterization in 1987 revealed that the grafts were patent
with the native vessels occluded. In 7/25 , he had an echo with
overall contraction normal , there was inferior and posterior
hypokinesis , mild anteroseptal , and diastolic dimension was judged
to be possibly global. In 1993 , he had an exercise tolerance test
consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia. He went six
minutes and seven seconds with a pulse of 70 and a blood pressure
of 150/70 with typical chest pain. He had a thallium at the same
time and that showed mild non-transmural defect inferiorly with no
ischemia. Also on 9/2/93 , he presented with a cough and had an
abnormal chest X-Ray. He was treated with antibiotics. He denies
any recent cough , fever , chills , or sources for infection. PAST

pulse of 60 , respirations 16 , and blood pressure 130/70. HEENT:
Pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light , extraocular
movements were intact , and pharynx was benign. NECK: Supple.
CHEST: Without wheezes or rales of the right greater than the
left. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation. CARDIAC: Examination showed
that he had a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , gallops , or
rubs , the apex was normal , there was no jugular venous distention ,
and carotids were 2+ with no bruits. ABDOMEN: Had normal active
bowel sounds and was soft and non-tender with no hepatomegaly.
RECTAL: Examination was deferred. NEUROLOGICAL: Examination was

LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Chest X-Ray revealed that he was status
post a coronary artery bypass graft with
lower lobe infiltrates bilaterally and EKG showed a rate of 50 ,
axis of 0 , intervals were normal , he had early R waves , and he had
questionable ST elevation in V2 , II , III , and F. His creatinine
was 1.4 with a BUN of 24 , glucose of 106 , sodium 138 , potassium
4.3 , chloride 99 , and bicarbonate 31. He had 190 platelets ,
hematocrit of 41 , and a white count of 5.4.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was assessed as having possible chest
pain and was put on a rule out myocardial
infarction protocol. The pain was said to be atypical but it was
considered best to rule him out. He was also started on
Ceftriaxone for a possible pneumonia. He had blood cultures times
two taken which subsequently came back normal and a PA and lateral
chest X-Ray , he did not have infiltrates so that was discontinued.
He went on to rule out for a myocardial infarction and he underwent
exercise thallium on which , on a modified Bruce protocol , he went
eight minutes with a heart rate of 93 , blood pressure 150/70 with
no ischemia but chest pain without episode of mild or reversible
defect , and an anterior transmural reversible defect. Patient was
told of his condition and was started on a beta blocker per
Cardiology. In the hospital , patient developed some episodes of
chest pain with EKG normal each time. His stomach had also felt
ascitic lately. Cardiology saw him and did not feel that the pain
