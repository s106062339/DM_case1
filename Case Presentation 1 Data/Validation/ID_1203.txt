CHIEF COMPLAINT: Rule out myocardial infarction.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 39-year-old white male with
multiple risk factors for coronary
artery disease , including sex , weight , hypertension , smoking ,
positive family history and cholesterol. He had a four month
history of exercise induced crescendo angina with palpitations and
had an exercise thallium study done on the day of admission. The
results of this showed questionable evidence of ischemia. He was
able to exercise for nine minutes and 16 seconds with a heart rate
of 160 and a blood pressure of 166/84. His test was stopped for
mild chest pain of 3/10 and fatigue. There was no EKG changes
except for some APCs , PVCs and upsloping ST changes. A thallium
scan showed a fixed inferior defect and anterior redistribution on
a later scan; this was on a preliminary reading. The final reading
is pending at this time. After the study , he continued to have
waxing and waning episodes of chest pressure that were not
completely relieved with nitroglycerin. In the emergency room , he
was treated with metoprolol , sublingual nitroglycerin , heparin
drip and aspirin. ALLERGIES: None known.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed a well appearing anxious man in no
apparent distress. The HEENT exam was
unremarkable. The neck was supple with a 0.5 cm nodule in the left
upper pole of the thyroid that is moveable and nontender. The
cardiovascular exam revealed no extra heart sounds or murmurs. The
lungs were clear. The abdomen was soft and nontender. The
extremities were without cyanosis , clubbing or edema. He had good
distal pulses and no bruits in the femoral arteries post
catheterization. The wound was clean.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Cholesterol 285; serial CKs 112 , 81 and
66; T-3 149; T-4 6.6; TSH 1.5.
HOSPITAL COURSE: He continued to have chest pain during the
evening with normal EKGs unchanged from
admission. Because of the continued nature of the pain , he was
placed on a nitroglycerin drip and given morphine sulfate which
controlled the pain. On the second hospital day he had a cardiac
catheterization of both sides of the heart which showed normal LV
function and normal coronaries per the cardiology note. He has
been free of chest pain since the procedure and has been taken off
of all of his medications.
DISPOSITION: He was discharged in good condition. MEDICATIONS ON
DISCHARGE: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. p.r.n. pain. FOLLOW

been informed of the findings on cardiac catheterization , and the
patient has been instructed to call her after his meeting with the
cardiologist. He has also been advised to lose some weight and to
modify his diet in order to correct his hypercholesterolemia. Dr.
Yoo will follow up on the thyroid nodule and the high
cholesterol.
