Discharge Date: 10/19/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 36 year-old male who
presented with chest pain for one
and one-half hours. In September , 1989 , he developed chest pain and
suffered an inferior myocardial infarction. He had an angioplasty
of his right coronary artery performed at that time. In April ,
1989 , he had more chest pain. Cardiac catheterization indicated
left anterior descending artery lesion. An angioplasty was
attempted and he had abrupt left anterior descending artery
closure , requiring emergent single vessel coronary artery bypass
grafting. He did well until August , 1996 , when he had more
angina. Cardiac catheterization showed a high grade left
circumflex lesion. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
of the left circumflex was successful. At that time , his cardiac
catheterization also showed that his saphenous vein to left
anterior descending artery graft was patent. His ejection fraction
was 68% by left ventriculogram at that time. In April , 1996 , he
had more chest pain and his cardiac catheterization showed no
significant change compared to his August , 1996 , cardiac
catheterization. One week prior to admission , the patient had
chest pain , which was quickly relieved by one sublingual
nitroglycerin. On the day of admission , while resting , he
developed anterior chest pressure with radiation to his neck ,
associated with some lightheadedness and nausea. There was no
diaphoresis or dyspnea. He took three sublingual nitroglycerin
with minimal relief. He came to the Emergency Room and his pain
resolved after one inch of nitroglycerin paste , 2 milligrams of
intravenous morphine , 325 milligrams of aspirin and supplemental
oxygen. The total duration of his pain was one and one-half hours.
He was then admitted to the Medical Short Stay Unit.
MEDICATIONS: Medications on admission were Atenolol 100
milligrams b.i.d.; Cardizem 60 milligrams p.o.
b.i.d.; pravastatin 20 milligrams p.o. q.d.; aspirin 325 milligrams
q.d.; sublingual nitroglycerin p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hepatitis C; hypercholesterolemia;
hypertension; coronary artery disease with
coronary artery bypass grafting in 1989.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He does not smoke.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He denied recent orthopnea or PND.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He was comfortable and pleasant.
Temperature was 97.8. Blood pressure
124/68. Heart rate 64. Respiratory rate 18. Oxygen saturation
96% on room air. Neck without jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1/S2. No murmurs.
Abdomen soft , nontender , nondistended. Extremities no cyanosis ,
clubbing or edema. Rectal occult blood negative.
Chest x-ray was negative by report. Electrocardiogram with pain
showed normal sinus rhythm at 61. Axis was 0. There was no
significant change compared to a September , 1997 , electrocardiogram. His
laboratory studies were notable for a CPK of 103. Liver function
tests were within normal limits. Troponin was 0.0. Hematocrit was
40.7.
HOSPITAL COURSE: He was admitted to the Medical Short Stay Unit
with chest pain. He underwent a rule out
myocardial infarction protocol with negative serial CPKs. He had
no events on cardiac monitor. He had no further episodes of chest
pain while in the hospital. On hospital day number two , he
underwent an exercise test. It was a standard Bruce protocol and
he exercised for 9 minutes 1 second , stopping secondary to leg
fatigue. He had no chest pain. His peak heart rate was 131. Peak
blood pressure was 200/100 with no electrocardiographic changes.
His test was read as showing no evidence of ischemia. The patient
was then discharged to home. There were no medication changes.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Same as on admission.
