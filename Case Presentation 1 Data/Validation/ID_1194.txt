ATTENDING: WATERFALL , SAMMY M.D.
MEDICAL SERVICE: General Medicine Team He Drive , Ville Sas Oaksco
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Quigg is a 42-year-old man with
history of diabetes , end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis ,
left Charcot foot complicated by recurrent cellulitis , who
presented with left lower leg swelling , erythema , and pain. The
patient does not recall having fevers at home , however , notes
that he "get fevers all the time" so he feels that he may not
have noticed. He did report that he had a temperature to about
101 and hemodialysis prior to admission for which he received one
dose of vancomycin. He denied having any symptoms of headache ,
chest pain , shortness of breath , abdominal pain , joint aches or
rash. He did endorse feeling fatigued with little energy. The
patient was referred to the Emergency Department given his
temperature of 101 at hemodialysis.
The patient has a long history of pain in his left foot secondary
to Charcot joint and chronic recurrent cellulitis including a
history of MRSA cellulitis. He has had numerous admissions to
SMC in the past year for treatment of the foot for which he
received several courses of antibiotics. He was treated from
10/5 through 10/24 with antibiotics posthemodialysis. At
the end of 10/24 , after returning from weekend away he had
severe exacerbation of the pain in his left foot with progressive
development of swelling on the bottom of his foot. At this time ,
he had extensive evaluation including an MRI of the foot and it
was felt that there was no evidence of osteomyelitis. His
antibiotics were discontinued at this time and he was discharged
to a nursing home for rehabilitation. He remained in the nursing
home from 1/18 through 5/22 and was discharged home two
weeks prior to admission.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Diabetes since the age of 23 , unclear if it is type 1 or type

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1 ) ID-Given his presentation of L lower leg swelling and
erythema , Mr. Bock was started on Vancomycin and Unasyn in the
emergency department. An X-ray of his L foot revealed significant
fragmentation and erosion of the tarsal/metatarsal bases and
focal soft tissue abnormality in the plantar region concerning
for abscess formation and possible osteomyelitis in the setting
of known Charcot arthropathy as well as diffuse soft tissue
swelling extending along the calf. Given these findings , he was
ordered for an MRI. With his MRI pending and his L leg looking
somewhat improved , his Unasyn was discontinued on HD 3 and he was
started on Augmentin and his Vancomycin was continued given his
history of MRSA cellulitis in the past. He spiked a fever on HD 3
and again on HD 4. On HD 5 , he had an MRI under conscious
sedation ( was attempted prior to this , but pt unable to
tolerate ). MRI revealed 4 cm fluid pocket in the subcutaneous
tissue of the plantar aspect of the left foot demonstrating
communication with the medial tendon sheaths and the ankle joint
with findings worrisome for abscess and osteomyelitis of at least
the medial malleolus , calcaneus , cuboid and talus. Infectious
disease was consulted and he was started on IV Levofloxacin and
IV Flagyl to cover gram negatives and anaerobes respectively and
his vancomycin continued to be dosed for level less than 20.
Orthopedics was consulted who performed an arthrocentesis of his
ankle as well as an arthrocentesis of the fluid collection at the
bottom of his foot. Ankle aspirate gram stain was negative , but
with 4+ polys. Fluid differential revealed >160 , 000 WBCs. In
consultation with infectious disease , orthopedics , and the
patient , it was decided that the best course of action would be a
L below knee amputation given the extent of the infection. This
was performed on HD 8 by Dr. Miears He did have fever spikes
again on HD 8-9 and had repeat blood cultures which were
negative. An echocardiogram was performed on HD 12. While he did
have a tiny focal thickening of the aortic cusp , this was
reviewed with Cardiology and infectious disease and was not
though to represent a vegetation. He was afebrile x >48 hours
prior to discharge. His surgical pathology returned with clean
margins on day of discharge , and as per ID consult service , he
does not need further antibiotics. He should have dry sterile
dressing changes to his residual limb daily. He may need an extra
dose of pain medication prior to this. If there is any evidence
of erythema or drainage , Dr. Fuller 's office should be
contacted at 365-299-5817.
2 ) Renal-Mr. Merriweather was on the renal service and had hemodialysis
3 times a week ( M/W/F ) without complication. Of note , he is
awaiting kidney transplant from his sister and is followed by Dr.
Felix Zelle at NNH .
3 ) Heme-Mr Vaeth was on coumadin as an outpatient. We obtained
his hospital records from NUOM and a vascular study from 9/19
showed evidence of a DVT in the L internal jugular vein from
5/5 The details surrounding this DVT are not documented ,
however Mr. Tirona reports that his vascular surgeon told him
that he should remain on Coumadin. His coumadin was held prior to
going to the OR and he was placed on a heparin drip. His coumadin
was restarted after his BKA and he was bridged with heparin with
a goal PTT of 60-80. Prior to discharge , he PTT was 103 and his
heparin drip was decreased from 2100 to 1950units per hours. He
should have a repeat PTT checked on transfer to his acute
rehabilitation center with goal PTT 60-80. INR on day of
discharge was 1.8 , 1.6 day prior to discharge. His heparin drip
can be discontinued once his INR is therapeutic with goal of 2-3.
His INR will need to be followed every 2-3 days until stable off
of levofloxacin.
4 ) CV
Ischemia-Mr Grana was on gemfibrozil 600mg bid and lipitor 80mg
as an outpatient. His lipid panel was checked: TC 140 , TG 151 ,
LDL 82 , HDL 28. Given that his LDL was 82 and the risk of
rhabdomylosis on high dose gemfibrozil and lipitor , his lipitor
was decreased to 20mg. He should have a repeat lipid panel in 4-6
weeks. He was also started on low dose b-blocker to reduce
perioperative MI risk prior to his surgery. He reported that he
is not on aspirin given that he has had b/l vitrectomies and his
doctor felt that the risk of bleeding was too high. This can be
readdressed as an outpatient.
Pump-Pt had elevated systolic blood pressures to the 160s in the
beginning of his stay. He was started on lisinopril which was
uptitrated to 5mg and also lopressor.
Rhtyhm-He had no evidence of arrythmias.
5 ) Endocrine-Mr. Rovella has DM which was diagnosed at age 23. It
is unclear if he has type I or II as he reported that he was told
he has Type I , but had a three year stint after diagnosis where
he was not on insulin. His FS on admission were elevated , likely
secondary to his infection and his lantus was uptitrated. He was
also started on prandial coverage. Prior to discharge , he was his
home dose of Lantus as well as Aspart with meals. He reported
that he already has an outpatient endocrinologist with whom he
will follow up. An HgA1c was 8.4.
6 ) Pain-Mr. Vanhee had significant post operative pain which
seemed to be mostly phantom limb pain. The acute pain service was
consulted and he was initially placed on a ketamine drip and
Fentanyl PCA. His fentanyl PCA and ketamine drip were
discontinued and he was started on oxycontin 80mg tid with
oxycodone for breakthrough pain. He was also started on Lyrica
for neuropathic pain. He was comfortable prior to discharge on
this current regimen. As his pain improves , he pain regimen
should be decreased.
7 ) Psychiatry-After learning that he would likely receive a
transplant from his sister , Mr. Potvin reports that he has had
significant anxiety prior to going for dialysis. Psychiatry
service was consulted who recommended low dose Ativan prior to
him going to dialysis.
