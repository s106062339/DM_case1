Discharge Date: 3/5/2001
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: INFERIOR MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. HYPERTENSION.
2. LEFT FRONTAL LOBE MENINGIOMA.
3. DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Testani is a 90+ year-old woman with
a history of hypertension , prior
atrial fibrillation , who presented to the Ie Health on
2/14/01 with shortness of breath and some chest pain lasting
several hours at home. She was brought in by her great
granddaughter and found to have ST segment elevations inferiorly on
an electrocardiogram concerning for inferior myocardial infarction.
At that point she was transferred to Hobert Center
for emergent catheterization. In the emergency room she was
treated with Lasix , Lopressor , morphine , nitropaste , aspirin and
heparin and then sent for cardiac catheterization. Cardiac
catheterization showed a right dominant system with no left main
disease , mid left anterior descending coronary artery 80 percent
lesion , a proximal left circumflex left anterior descending
coronary artery lesion and a proximal 100 percent posterior
descending coronary artery stenosis. The posterior descending
coronary artery was intervened upon and stented to a residual
stenosis of 0 percent. The patient tolerated the procedure well
without any complications and was then transferred to the intensive
care unit for further monitoring. On admission to the coronary
care unit the patient had no complaints , including no shortness of
breath , and no chest pain. She was noted to have a right groin
hematoma for which pressure was held.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , atrial fibrillation , history
of pulmonary edema , left frontal lobe
meningioma as documented by MRI of the brain in February of 2000.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Lasix dose unknown , atenolol 50 mg p.o.
q day , Zestril 10 mg per day , Isordil 10
mg t.i.d. and meclizine p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature 98 , heart rate 75 , blood pressure
140/70 , respiratory rate 16 , 94 percent on 2 liters
of oxygen. GENERAL: Awake , alert and oriented in no acute
distress. Oropharynx is clear. Crackles present bilaterally
throughout both lung fields. CARDIAC: Regular , rate and rhythm.
Normal S1 and S2. II/VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal
border. No radiation to the neck. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender and
nondistended. Positive bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: No edema. 2
plus dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. NEUROLOGICAL: Neurologic
status intact. Nonfocal exam.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: White blood cell count 13.6 ,
hematocrit 39 , platelets 222 , 000.
Sodium 141 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 100 , bicarbonate 26 , BUN 37 ,
creatinine 2.0 , glucose 192. PT was 11 , PTT 23 , INR 0.88. CK
number one is 216 with no MB fraction done prior to transfer. CK
number two post cardiac catheterization 2577 , MB 310 , troponin
3.49.
Electrocardiogram prior to transfer showed normal sinus rhythm at
the time pre-catheterization. Rate of 75. Two millimeter ST
segment elevation in leads II , III and F.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular: The patient was transferred
to the coronary care unit after cardiac
catheterization and right coronary artery stent for further
management. She ruled in for a myocardial infarction. Her peak CK
was 2577 with a MB fraction of 310. Troponin on admission was
3.49. She was placed on aspirin , Plavix , Lopressor , Zestril and
simvastatin. Two days after this initial catheterization on
10/10/01 , the patient was transferred to the floor and subsequently
had an episode of flash pulmonary edema and was thought to be to
diastolic dysfunction. This occurred in the context of her having
a systolic blood pressure of 200. She was then transferred back to
the coronary care unit where she had intermittent complaints of
chest pain. Electrocardiogram showed pseudo normalization of the T
waves laterally. Her CKs continued to trend down however due to
the concern of further ischemia she was placed on heparin and
brought back to the catheterization laboratory on 6/27/01 for
stenting of the left circumflex lesion. Since the second stent she
continued to do well from a cardiovascular standpoint. Her CKs
continued to trend down. An echocardiogram was done which showed
an ejection fraction of 45 percent , inferior posterior akinesis ,
moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
She was managed with aspirin , Plavix with plans to keep her on this
for one month , Zocor and Lopressor. Due to a rising creatinine
after the second catheterization her Zestril has been stopped and
she has been started on hydralazine until her creatinine
normalizes.
2. Renal: The patient has a baseline creatinine of 1.6 which
increased to 4.0 after her second catheterization. The etiology is
deemed to be contrast induced nephropathy. Her creatinine is now
improving down to 3.2 at the time of discharge. This should be
followed and her Zestril restarted at 10 mg per day and the
hydralazine stopped when the creatinine normalizes to below 2.0.
Electrolytes were stable throughout the admission.
3. Pulmonary: No active issues currently. She did have an
episode of flash pulmonary edema in the setting of high blood
pressure found to be due to diastolic dysfunction. The goal is to
control the patient's blood pressure to avoid these episodes.
There is no need for diuresis.
4. Gastrointestinal: The patient was admitted with a hematocrit
of 39 but did drop to 27 slowly during the course of the admission.
She did have guaiac positive stools while on heparin. She was
transfused a total of two units to keep her hematocrit above 30 and
for the five days prior to discharge , her hematocrit was stable at
34. The patient consumes a low fat low cholesterol diet and is on
Prilosec 20 mg q day.
5. Psychiatry/neurologic: The patient was noted to sun down at
night with episodes of confusion and agitation. A psychiatry
consult was obtained and felt that the patient's behavior was
consistent with dementia and recommended starting Zyprexa. The
patient was placed on standing Zyprexa 5 mg at night and continued
to improve on this medication. She had no episodes of agitation
after being transferred to the floor. In addition she has a
history of left frontal lobe mass which is consistent with a
meningioma. This has been noted on CT and MRI scans done in February
of 2000. Neurosurgery consult was obtained and felt that surgery
would not be a good option for this patient , in addition they did
not feel that the mass was responsible for any mental status
changes.
6. Infectious disease: The patient has a history of a positive
RPR which has not been treated previously. She is now being
treated for syphilis with benzathine penicillin 2.4 million units
times three injections. She has one injection pending which is due
on 3/5/01. In addition she has had a negative lumbar puncture
for neurologic syphilis.
DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient is to be discharged to the
Chora Medical Center with
eventual plans to return to home.
She will also follow up with a new primary care provider , Dr. Ernesto Fouch at the Crestsant Health on 2/2/01.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q 4 hours p.r.n.
pain , aspirin 325 mg p.o. q day , Colace
100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Robitussin 15 cc p.o. q 4 hours p.r.n. cough ,
hydralazine 20 mg p.o. q.i.d. Plan to stop hydralazine when
creatinine returns below 2.0 and at that time Zestril 10 mg per day
should be started. Lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , nitroglycerin
p.r.n. , Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q day , penicillin benzathine 2.4
million units IM q weeks , last dose on 3/5/01. Percocet 1-2
tablets p.o. q 8 hours p.r.n. osteoarthritic pain , Zocor 20 mg p.o.
q HS , Imdur 30 mg p.o. q day , Zyprexa 5 mg p.o. q h.s. , Plavix 75
mg p.o. q day times 24 days.
