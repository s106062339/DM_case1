BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
50 y.o. female with multiple medical problems
including obesity , IDDM , hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , sleep
apnea presents with worsening SOB x 1 month. She reports that
following a pneumonia about 1 year ago , she has
felt progressively short of breath. Over the
past month , her symptoms have become
incerasingly bothersome , interfering with her ability to
talk , walk , and exert herself. She denies
fever/chills/ chest pain/palpitations/PND , but does report
4 pillow orthopnea ( increased from 2 ) , nocturia
( at baseline ). She presented to her pulmonologist
5/6 who felt that her lung disease was
most consistent with restrictive lung disease due
to her obesity. She presented to her allergist
3 days PTA , who felt that she had a CXR
consistent with CHF and increased her lasix to 100 qdx 3 days
with some effect. She presented to her PCP on the
day of admission and was noted to have a decreased
O2 sat; she was sent to TSGH for further evaluation.
Of note , she has many allergies , including latex , was a 1.5 ppd smoker
x 30 years , quit one and a half years ago , and has recently started a
weight loss program , losing 22 pounds in 3
months. In the ED , she was given aspirin ,
solumedrol , nebs , and ativan with some relief. Pertinent exam
findings: markedly obese , labored breathing at times , but speaking
in full sentences. No JVD. Lungs: rare wheezes , few crackles at
bases , no signs of consolidation. CV: distant , RRR , S1 S2
Abd: soft , obese Ext: trace edema , WWP , no calf tenderness. A/P: Pulm:
Likely restrictive component due to obesity as well as deconditioning ,
likely anxiety component as well as possible pulmonary hypertension due
to sleep apnea , smoking hx. Subjectively , acute exacerbation of sx may
also be related to heat/humidity. Nebs for comfort , but primary goal
is for increased cardiopulmonary fitness , weight loss. CPAP for sleep
apnea as well. Outpatient pulmonary rehab. O2 sat 97% on RA with
ambulation prior to d/c. Symptoms improved. CV: continue cardiac
meds , lipid lowering agents. ID: no infectious etiology/sx Endo: Type 2
