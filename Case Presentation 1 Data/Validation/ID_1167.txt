The condition responsible for causing this admission is
congestive heart failure exacerbation. Other diagnoses include
left bundle branch block , paresthesias in the fingers , benign
prostatic hypertrophy , prostatic adenocarcinoma , Gleason's score
2/4 , C5-C6 and C6-C7 disk disease , status post left nephrectomy
for renal cell carcinoma , hyperplastic polyps in 1993 and also
status post AICD and dual chamber pacer.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 73-year-old male
well known to the CHF Service with long-standing New York Heart
Association class 3B idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy presenting
with shortness of breath and increasing orthopnea over the last
night prior to admission from 8 to 9 p.m. The patient first went
to An Medical Center ER then left AMA without further treatment after
waiting four hours. He reports increasing cough with white
sputum since 5/8 , dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea especially
over the last three days. Also there is a questionable increase
in abdominal distention. The patient had been admitted five
times in the last six months with the last admission also for
worsening dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea and cough in which he
notably had a TEE-guided cardioversion and diuresis. He was
discharged on creatinine of 1.7. The patient freely admits that
he has had dietary indiscretion over the last two months ,
claiming that he has been "eating like a horse" with meat and
heavy sauces on pasta. The patient denies chest pain , fevers ,
sick contacts , chills , weight gain or nausea.
ALLERGIES: The patient has allergies to erythromycin and
penicillin , which causes a rash. He also describes an allergy to
contrast.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was alert and oriented and in
no acute distress with blood pressure of 82/62 , heart rate of 80
beats per minute. His HEENT exam was unremarkable. Carotid
upstrokes were brisk without bruits. There were no thyromegaly
and his chest exam was clear to auscultation and percussion.
Cardiac exam did demonstrate JVP of about 18 cm and also regular
rate and rhythm with an S1 , S2 as well as an S3 and 1/6
holosystolic murmur at the apex. The abdominal exam was notable
for an enlarged abdomen , but nondistended and without pulsatile
palpable liver edge. There was no tenderness to palpation. The
extremities were warm and with 1+ distal pulses and only trace
edema.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission were notable for BUN of 45 ,
creatinine of 1.6 , K of 4.3 and sodium of 136. The INR was 1.3.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular. The patient was in volume overload and his
ARB and Aldactone were held. Aggressive diuresis was undertaken
for most of this stay including an IV Lasix drip , which was later
weaned to a torsemide IV b.i.d. which was later changed to p.o.
b.i.d. for a questionable reaction to the IV formation in the
form of itchiness. He was also put on Zaroxolyn throughout the
stay and he was started on dopamine drip , which was later
discontinued on 7/20/05 for long runs of NSVT that he had
possibly secondary to sensitivity to the dopamine. However ,
dobutamine was started on 2/11/05 and this dosage was increased
gradually over 8/1/05 to 1/19/05 to rate about 3 mcg/kg and
the patient tolerated this dosage fairly well. In addition ,
electrolytes were repleted throughout the stay and the patient
underwent a workup for an LVAD placement including PFTs ,
peripheral and carotid Dopplers and an abdominal ultrasound. He was shown to
have significant aortic vascular disease which was felt to represent a
contra-indication for LVAD. Discussion ongoing with the patient during his
stay revealed that he would prefer not to have the LVAD
even if he were eligible. He understood that he was not likely to live long
with the severity of his heart failure. The decision was later made to send
the patient home with a Hickman catheter placed on 11/6/05 , so that he could
receive home dobutamine. In terms of ischemia , the first set of
enzymes were flat and ischemia was judged not to be an active
issue. There were no changes on EKG. In terms of rhythm , the
patient does have history of prior AFib , however , he has remained
in normal sinus rhythm , status post cardioversion. He has had
asymptomatic runs of NSVT on the dopamine and less so on the
dobutamine as mentioned above. Currently he was paced with an
AICD. We kept the patient on amiodarone and digoxin as well as
on tele.
2. Renal: The patient has a history of chronic renal
insufficiency and is status post left nephrectomy. We monitored
the patient's BUN and creatinine while diuresing and although ,
the patient did have an increased BUN to about 70 , diuretic
treatment was continued as a primary goal.
3. Endo. The patient has diabetes and we held oral glycemics ,
putting him on regular insulin sliding scale and NPH doses. Also
the patient had low TSH. This is probably due to subclinical
hypothyroidism or sick euthyroid.
4. Heme. The patient is on Coumadin as an outpatient and we
titrated his INR to a goal of 2-3. The patient did have some
nosebleeds on 10/21 and his Coumadin was temporarily held , but
restarted again for this goal of 2-3 later. The INR goal was
decreased less than 1.5 where the placement of Hickman catheter
with the plan to restart the Coumadin after placement.
5. Prostate. The patient does have a history of prostate
adenocarcinoma , Gleason 2/5 on biopsy in 2004. This has been
discussed with the patient by his urologist and the patient has
refused surgery now with an increased PSA , however , we did
consult a Urology while the patient was here and it was deemed
that his prostate should not be a major prognostic consideration
given the degree of his heart failure.
Physical exam at discharge , in general the patient was
comfortable and in no apparent distress , sitting up and eating
his food comfortably as far as the HEENT and neck exam his JVP
was about 10 cm. Cardiovascular exam showed occasional PVCs and
a loud P2 and S3. In general unchanged from admission.
Respiratorywise his lungs were clear to auscultation and breath
sounds were equal bilaterally. His abdomen was somewhat
decreased in size from admission , soft and non-tensed.
Extremities were warm without edema. Pulses were 1+ radial and
dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally as with admission he did have
some wasted lower extremities.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to home with VNA
Services. The plan is to follow his INR on Coumadin and to
continue to monitor his heart for NSVT while on dobutamine. Also
consider an ARB or Aldactone. The patient has stable kidney
function with decreasing creatinine.
