Discharge Date: 10/17/2001
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: UNSTABLE ANGINA.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE , STATUS POST STENT OF
THE RCA.
OTHER SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: EXTENSIVE CARDIAC HISTORY , DVT WITH
PE X TWO , CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY ,
HEPATITIS B POSITIVE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 63-year-old male presenting
with unstable angina. His first presentation with coronary disease
was in 1986 , when he ruled in for MI and a cath revealed 100%
occlusion of the circumflex , 99% D1 , and a subsequent angioplasty
of the circ to a 70% residual. He had an exercise treadmill two
months later and a repeat cath at that time showed 95% restenosis
of the circ and a 60% LAD lesion , and a 90% D1. In October of
1992 the patient again presented with exertional angina. Cath
revealed 70% occlusion of the RCA , 70-80% LAD , and diffuse disease
in the circumflex with a 50% mid-circumflex lesion. He had diffuse
global hypokinesis and an EF of 40-50%. His angina progressed and
in 1994 he underwent a four vessel CABG , SVG to the PDA and OM-1 ,
and a LIMA to the LAD and D2. He did well until 1997 , when he
presented with presyncope and was found to have a massive saddle
pulmonary embolism. He had a negative hypercoagulative workup
after this. In the recent years he has had a number of episodes of
epigastric pain with exertion and positive stress tests , but no
additional myocardial infarctions. His most recent cath in July
of 1997 showed an occluded circumflex , 80% LAD , and subtotal
occlusion distally , a 60% mid-RCA lesion , and patent SVG to the PDA
and the OM , as well as the LIMA to the LAD. In recent months the
patient describes increasing frequency of anginal episodes provoked
by walking more than five minutes or climbing stairs. Most often
the pain is epigastric , but occasionally substernal. He denies
associated symptoms of nausea , diaphoresis , or radiation of the
pain , but says it is hard to catch his breath. The patient denies
orthopnea , PND , or lower extremity edema. He has never had pain at
rest. On February the patient underwent an exercise treadmill
test walking five minutes on the standard Bruce protocol , reaching
a heart rate of 96 and a blood pressure of 130/70. He had chest
pain as well as 1 mm ST depressions. Since then his angina has
occurred with less and less exertion until the morning of
admission , when he walked outside and experienced substernal chest
tightness. He again denies nausea , diaphoresis , palpitations , or
radiation of the pain , but does have some shortness of breath. The
pain lasts approximately 10-15 minutes and the patient was advised
by his cardiologist , Dr. Raymond Merrihew , to come to the Emergent
Department. In the Emergent Department he was pain free and
received aspirin and was started on heparin. EKG showed no acute
changes. CK was 47 and a troponin of 0.24.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes , hypertension ,
hypercholesterolemia , chronic DVTs with
pulmonary embolism x two , CVA , left temporal in the setting of an
INR of 4 , with some residual memory and expressive deficits. He is
now on Lovenox subcu for DVT prophylaxis. Chronic renal
insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.5 , hepatitis B
positive , and recent eye surgery in January of 2001.
ALLERGIES: Benadryl , which causes shortness of breath.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Glucophage 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Avandia 4
mg p.o. b.i.d. , atenolol 50 mg p.o. q. day , aspirin 325 mg q. day ,
gemfibrozil 600 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q. day.
INITIAL PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature 98.6 , heart rate 60 , blood
pressure 110/90 , upper 70 , oxygen
saturation 98% on 2 L. In general , he is a 63-year-old Asian male ,
well appearing and in no acute distress. HEENT: Pupils equal ,
round , and reactive. Extraocular muscles intact. Oral mucosa are
moist. There is no jugular venous distention , no lymphadenopathy.
Neck is supple. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally , without
wheezes or rales. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm ,
without murmurs , rubs , or gallops. ABDOMEN: Soft , nondistended ,
and mildly tender to palpation in the epigastrium. There is no
rebound or guarding. Extremities are warm and well perfused , with
no edema.
INITIAL LABORATORIES: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.7 , chloride 106 ,
bicarb 24 , BUN 15 , creatinine 1.5 , glucose
253 , white count 5.3 , hematocrit 36.8 , platelets 144 , calcium 9.5 ,
mag 1.7 , CK 47 , troponin slightly elevated at 0.23 , INR 1.1. EKG
reveals normal sinus rhythm at 60 , with normal axis and inferiorly
flattened T waves , with T in 1 , L in 6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascularly , the patient was continued
on heparin and ruled out for MI by CKs. On 10/21
he underwent cardiac catheterization , which showed an 80% proximal
LAD , 100% proximal circ , 80% proximal RCA , and 80% proximal right
PDA. His LIMA to the D2 and the LAD were patent , as was the SVG to
OM-1. The SVG to the RCA was 100% occluded. A stent was placed in
the native mid-RCA and angioplasty was undertaken of the right PDA.
After the procedure , the heparin was discontinued and he was
transitioned to Lovenox 40 mg subcu q. day for DVT prophylaxis. An
echo was obtained , which showed mildly enlarged left ventricle with
moderate reduction in function and EF of 35%. There is thinning
and hypokinesis to akinesis of the posterior and inferior segments ,
as well as hypokinesis to akinesis of the distal septum. The RV
was normal. Pulmonary artery pressures are 25+ right atrial
pressure. The patient continues to have episodes of epigastric
discomfort and belching , and his EKG revealed only nonspecific T
wave changes. He was scheduled to undergo a submax exercise
treadmill test , but this was held due to an increase in his
troponin initially from .23 to .73 , suggesting that he was having
some mild ischemia with the likely culprit being the small PDA that
had been angioplastied during cath. Recath was thought to be low
yield without anything to intervene upon after discussion with the
interventional Cardiology Service. His medical regimen was
maximized and included a beta blocker , ACE inhibitor , and nitrates.
His cardiac enzymes trended down to a CK of 32 and a troponin of
0.33 upon discharge. He underwent submaximum ETT on 3/10 and
walked for nine minutes without EKG changes , but did experience
6/10 chest pain and some belching. The test was considered
consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia. Of note , he
reached a max heart rate of 68 and a blood pressure of 142/80
during this submaximum stress test. The patient will be discharged
to home to have close follow-up with his cardiologist , Dr. Devin Peachey He will also have a follow-up stress test. He will see his
primary care physician , Dr. Panciera , for monitoring of his other
medical issues , including his diabetes. Discharge condition is
stable , discharge diet is low fat diabetic diet , and discharge
medications are enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day , atenolol
50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , gemfibrozil 600 mg p.o. b.i.d. , glyburide 10 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. , nitroglycerin 0.4 mg one
tab sublingual a.q. 5 minutes x three p.r.n. chest pain , ramipril 5
mg p.o. q. day , Lovenox 40 mg subcu q. day x 70 days , Plavix 75 mg
p.o. q. day x 25 days ( a total of 30 days since the stent ) , Lipitor
10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , and Avandia 4 mg p.o. b.i.d.
