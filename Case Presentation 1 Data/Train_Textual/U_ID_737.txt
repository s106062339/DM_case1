Discharge Date: 6/9/2000
SERVICE: Coll Lum All
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Pyelonephritis.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Urinary tract infection. Bilateral adnexal
masses. Diabetes mellitus.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Cristopher Ottilige is a 53 year old woman
with a history of diabetes mellitus
who presents with abdominal pain and fevers over two weeks
duration. Two weeks prior to admission , the patient had headaches ,
nausea , vomiting , presyncope , anorexia with mild periumbilical
pain. She also had fevers to 101 degrees F. with associated chills
and diaphoresis. The patient presented to her primary care
physician three days before admission and was found to have
elevated liver function tests with AST of 39 , ALT of 108. At that
time , the patient was presumed to have a viral syndrome. Two days
prior to admission , the patient developed worsening abdominal pain.
The pain was described as sharp , constant in character with
radiation to the back. The pain was more intense in the right
lower quadrant. The pain was also noted to be in the lower flanks
and the costovertebral angle area. The patient has noted no change
in her usual bowel habits of one stool per week. She has had no
diarrhea , constipation , melena , or hematochezia. She has had no
hematemesis. She denies any urinary symptoms but only has
nocturia. Of note , the patient had menopause approximately eight
years ago , but in each of the last three months she has noticed
monthly vaginal bleeding which she believes are a resumption of
menstrual cycles. The last episode was about one month ago. The
patient also has a history of nephrolithiasis but feels that this
current pain is different from the one she has had in the past.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension , diabetes
mellitus diagnosed two years ago , obesity ,
obstructive sleep apnea , nephrolithiasis , osteoarthritis , glaucoma.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Notable for cesarean section 20 years ago
that was complicated by pulmonary embolism.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1. Lasix 60 mg q day. 2. Glyburide 5 mg
q day. 3. Labetalol 200 mg b.i.d.
4. Timoptic , Xylatan drops for glaucoma.
ALLERGIES: Lidocaine leads to rash. Lisinopril leads to cough.
Diltiazem leads to edema. Nifedipine leads to edema.
Intravenous contrast leads to hives.
FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for cardiovascular disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married and has two children. She
denies any use of alcohol or tobacco.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 102 , heart rate 90 , respiratory
rate 34 , blood pressure 143/48. Oxygen
saturation 91% on 2 liters nasal cannula. HEENT: Pupils equal ,
round , reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular muscles
intact. Anicteric sclerae. Oropharynx clear. No jugular venous
distension. CHEST: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. HEART:

right lower quadrant pain. Rebound tenderness and mild guarding.
Bowel sounds are present but decreased. BACK: No costovertebral
angle tenderness. CERVIX: Cervical motion tenderness is present.
NEUROLOGIC: The patient is alert and oriented x3.
LABORATORY: Chemistries revealed sodium 132 , potassium 4.2 ,
chloride 94 , CO2 32 , BUN 13 , creatinine 1. Glucose
315 , calcium 9.9. Liver function tests showed ALT 58 , AST 23 , ALK
127 , total bilirubin 1.2 , albumin 4.6 , globulin 3.1 , amylase 28 ,
lipase 145 , total protein 7.7. The complete blood cell count
revealed a white blood cell count of 23.91 , hemoglobin 14.1 ,
hematocrit 41.8 , platelets 520. The differential showed 77 polys ,
7 bands , 6 lymphocytes , and 6 monocytes. The urinalysis was
notable for pH 5.5 , protein 1+ , glucose 1+ , leukocytes 1+ , nitrite
positive , trace ketones , and no blood. Sediments showed white
blood cells 45 - 50 , 4+ bacteria , 1+ squamous epithelial cells , 1 -
2 casts. Abdominal CT was notable for a 7 x 8 cm low density fluid
collection in the region of the right adnexa and a 4 x 8 cm low
density fluid collection in the left adnexa. A UCG was negative.
PROCEDURES: September , 2000 , endometrial biopsy. The procedure
was limited due to the patient's body habitus. The
biopsy revealed no evidence of malignancy. Complications none.
HOSPITAL COURSE: By systems:
1. GENITOURINARY. The patient's presenting
symptoms and abdominal CT findings of bilateral adnexal masses were
suspicious for a tubo-ovarian abscess. However , the patient did
not have any of the associated risk factors , given that the patient
is not sexually active and denied introducing any foreign objects
into the vagina. The patient was initially managed on triple
antibiotics , ampicillin , gentamicin , and Clindamycin. Since a CT
scan is not the optimal test to evaluate the adnexa , a transvaginal
ultrasound was ordered which revealed endometrial thickness of 3.6
mm and bilateral cystic masses. The patient's right upper quadrant
pain and tenderness persisted for several days during the admission
with periodic exacerbations and was increasingly suspicious for
cholelithiasis or pancreatitis. The patient then had an abdominal
ultrasound which was essentially was within normal limits and
showed no abnormal viscera. The bilateral adnexal masses continued
to be of major concern , and interventional radiology was consulted
for possible aspiration. Given that the etiology of the masses was
unclear and the risk of malignancy in a post menopausal woman , it
was decided that the best approach would be open tissue sampling.
It was then decided to postpone this procedure pending further
evaluation of the patient. Of note , the patient had a CA-125 drawn
which 77. Serum HCG was negative. The patient's report of new
onset of post menopausal bleeding was concerning. Considering the
high likelihood of malignancy , the patient was being followed by
the gynecology oncology service and underwent endometrial biopsy
for tissue sampling. The biopsy revealed no evidence of
malignancy. The patient had a repeat CT scan on hospital day
number seven which was essentially unchanged from admission showing
persistent bilateral adnexal masses and no free fluid. The
patient's symptoms of right lower quadrant pain persisted but
became more responsive to treatment toward the end of the
admission. Throughout the admission the actual etiology of the
bilateral adnexal masses was never discerned. As a result , the
patient was referred to the gynecology oncology service for
continued follow up as an outpatient.
2. INFECTIOUS DISEASE. The patient's presentation of fevers ,
chills , and diaphoresis was certainly suspicious for infectious
process. Initially the patient was covered with ampicillin ,
gentamicin , and Clindamycin for empiric antimicrobial coverage.
The urine culture was notable for greater than 100 , 000 Escherichia
coli which was pan sensitive. All blood cultures at initial
presentation had been negative. On October , the creatinine
level increased to 1.8. As a result , gentamicin was then switched
to Levofloxacin. The patient's fever initially defervesced from
102.2 to 99.3 , but spiked to 100.1 after six days of antibiotics.
Her white blood cell count remained elevated and ranged from 24 to
32. However , by discharge the white blood cell count was 10.
Because of the patient's initial minimal response to antibiotics ,
repeat blood cultures and urine cultures were sent which were
negative. In addition , ID was consulted to provide further
guidance regarding antimicrobial management. They recommended to
continue ampicillin and Levofloxacin. Clindamycin was changed to
Flagyl. By discharge , the patient was afebrile.
3. CARDIOVASCULAR. By hospital day number two , the patient was
noted to have increased lower extremity swelling and new bibasilar
crackles. The symptoms were suggestive of volume overload and
possibly congestive heart failure. A chest x-ray was notable for
bilateral atelectasis in the lower lobes but no pulmonary edema or
pleural effusions. A cardiac echocardiogram revealed normal
systolic function with ejection fraction of approximately 60% and
mild left ventricular hypertrophy. The patient was treated with
Lasix and was aggressively diuresed. She responded well to
treatment.
4. NEUROLOGIC. The patient presented with abdominal pain and was
initially with Demerol and Vistaril. Initially the patient was
only minimally responsive to treatment , but over time she became
more responsive. By discharge , the patient was without pain.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home and required no
services.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was advised to call her
primary care physician for fevers greater
than 100.5 , chills , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain. The patient
was also advised to take her temperature every day. The patient
was scheduled to follow up with her primary care physician in one
week. She will also follow up with the gynecology oncology service
for further evaluation of bilateral adnexal masses and post
menopausal bleeding.
