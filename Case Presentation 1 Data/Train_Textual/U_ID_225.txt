BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of multiple
myeloma , and worsening BPH ( benign prostatic hypertrophy ) ,
requiring a Foley. The patient was seen in Randuke Hospital on the day of admission and was noted to have a
hematocrit drop from the 37 range to 28.5 along with hypotension
and an increasing creatinine rising from 1.2-2.3 in one week's
time.
The patient was noted to have recently significantly increasing
lower extremity edema. He reports that over a 3-4 day period , he
went from having almost no edema to having very large legs , which
he describes "tree trunks." The patient reports that these were
painful at first , but are no longer painful. He reports that
they were always symmetric. The patient reports no prior history
of CHF ( congestive heart failure ) , or any severe cardiac
problems , which he is aware , but does report having heart attack
at 27 years old. The patient did not know the details of these
cardiac events at 27 years old , and has received minimal followup
for this issue. He does report that he was intermittently seen
by a cardiologist , and had a normal catheterization four years
ago. He reports he has never had an echocardiogram.
The patient also reports an episode of 30-minute chest tightness
the day prior to admission while he was having a Foley catheter
placed. The patient did not tell anyone about this at that time ,
and this pain desisted on its own. The pain was described as
substernal burning pain , with no left arm pain , no jaw pain , no
shortness of breath or diaphoresis , and no nausea or vomiting.
The patient has had no orthopnea or PND.
The patient has had a recent history increasingly worsening BPH.
The patient has a 15-year history of BPH , and is followed by Dr.
Tod Cutshall at Kernmilf Nadrock Hospital And Health Center .  The patient was
recently admitted to SHHC for anuria , had a cystoscopy , clot
evacuation and was discharged on 7/24/05 with a Foley in place.
The patient followed up with Dr. Queen on 10/21/05 , had his
Foley removed , but failed this trial and he represented to an
outside hospital with clots and anuria. The patient's bladder
was irrigated and the Foley was replaced. He reports that he has
been passing clots but that he has been passing urine. The
patient also reports that his urine while having clots at times ,
is mostly clear and yellow , and that he continually makes urine
and has to replace the Foley bag.

BRIEF PHYSICAL EXAM:
Vital signs: Temperature 96.5 , pulse 70 , blood pressure 100/62 ,
respiratory rate 20 and the patient is satting 95% on room air.
General: The patient is alert , oriented , in no acute distress ,
and is not ill appearing. HEENT: Normocephalic , atraumatic ,
oropharynx is clear. No lesions or ulcers. No lymphadenopathy.
Anicteric sclerae. Cardiovascular , has JVP elevated to the angle
of the jaw. Regular rate and rhythm , with frequent premature
beat. No S3 or S4 appreciated. Pulmonary: A few crackles at
the left base otherwise clear to auscultation. Abdomen: Soft ,
nontender , bowel sounds present and normoactive. No
hepatosplenomegaly , no frank dullness. Extremities: 2-3+
pitting edema to the knees , symmetric bilaterally , shins
lukewarm. Strength 5/5 throughout in upper and lower
extremities. Neurological: The patient is alert and oriented
x3 , has normal affect. Reflexes in the biceps , patellar , and
Achilles tendons are equal bilaterally. Sensation grossly intact
on upper and lower extremities.
PERTINENT LABORATORY RESULTS:
On admission , the patient's white blood cell count was 7.2 , his
hematocrit was 28.5 , down from 37 one week previously. The
patient's platelet count was 238 , 000. The patient's chem-7 was
unremarkable with the exception of a creatinine of 2.3 , up from a
baseline of 1.2-1.4 over one week's time. The patient had a BNP
checked , which turned out to be 312 , elevated. The patient has
also had several recent imaging studies including renal
ultrasound on 2/6/05 , which showed multiple bilateral renal
cysts but no obstruction. An abdominal MRI was obtained on
2/20/05 , which showed small amount of ascites , an enlarged
prostate , multiple renal cysts , no other pathologies was noted.
The patient also had a CT to evaluate his ureters on 10/8/05 ,
which showed no stones in the kidneys or ureters , but an enlarged
prostate.
A cystoscopy report from 9/23/05 from a recent admission to
Ma Faulkmark Hospital showed oozing from tortuous veins in
the prostate.
The patient had an EKG , which showed first-degree block with a
left bundle branch block , and frequent PVCs. This was noted to
be present on an old examination , after consultation with an
outpatient cardiologist at Perlaw Memorial Hospital .  The patient
had a troponin I of 0.11 , slightly elevated. The patient's CK
was 136 , MB fraction 4.3 , both within normal limits. On
admission , the patient coagulation parameters showed an INR of
1.2. Other pertinent data includes an orally reported cardiac
catheterization at Beckry Hospital in 2001 , which showed no
obstructive coronary disease , but diffuse coronary artery
disease , with an ejection fraction of 50%. An adenosine MIBI
obtained in 2002 at Peacepe Planthugh Memorial Medical Center showed possible old
inferior infarct , global hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of
35-40%. An echocardiogram obtained during this admission
demonstrated the patient's EF at this point to be 25% , rather
with global hypokinesis.
OPERATIONS OR PROCEDURES:
There were no operations or procedures performed during this
admission.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
Cardiovascular - the patient was determined initially to be
likely in congestive heart failure , with elevated neck veins , and
increased leg edema and a low blood pressure. Because the
patient was determined to be in CHF , he was diuresed with IV
Lasix , and later with p.o. Lasix , the patient was diuresed
approximately 2 liters per day over a 4-5 period. The patient's
blood pressure subsequently rose. After consultation with
Cardiology , it was determined that a beta blocker and an ACE
inhibitor should be added to the patient's medication regimen as
his blood pressure would allow , for demonstrated benefit and
congestive heart failure.
Because the patient was initially determined to have some risk of
myocardial infarction , had reported chest pain the day prior to
admission , and had slightly elevated troponins. The patient's
troponin and CK-MB were followed until they began decreasing. It
is likely that these very small elevations were due to small
amount of ischemia from demand , due to the patient's fluid
overload and anemia. The patient was continued on his statin
medication.
The patient on admission had frequent PVCs , and some short runs
of ventricular tachycardia lasting less than 5 beats. After
diuresis , the patient had no further runs of VT , and had only
minimal ectopy. The patient's electrolytes including potassium
and magnesium were checked daily and repleted as necessary.
Aspirin was withheld from the patient for now , despite having a
benefit in cardiac disease of this kind. This is because the
patient's hematocrit was low and he had recently had bleeding
likely from his bladder. Urology Department was consulted
regarding this decision.
Renal/genitourinary: The patient has a long known history of BPH
and is followed closely at Cotson Tionlo Hospital by Dr.
Josue Grefe . The patient was recently admitted for these
problems due to obstruction , and instrumentation. On admission ,
the patient's urine did not have any red blood cells , and he had
no obvious clots at any point. After consultation with Urology ,
and after the patient had been diuresing well with Lasix , the
patient's Foley catheter was removed and after this point he had
no problem with urinating. The patient was maintained on Proscar
in addition to Flomax.
Heme: The patient's hematocrit drop was likely due to two
factors. First of all , the patient is known to have been losing
blood in the form of clots from his bladder. This is likely due
to bleeding from the surface of his prostate where a recent
cystoscopy had demonstrated tortuous veins. In addition , the
reading of hematocrit of 24.5 on admission was likely secondary
to dilution , the patient was massively fluid overloaded. The
patient's hematocrit rose after diuresis , and was maintained in
the 31-32 range without transfusion during admission. He was ,
however , typed and screened , and the plan was to transfuse him
should his hematocrit decrease below 30 , given his cardiac
history.
Oncologic: The patient is followed closely by Dr. Zecchini at
Hool Norhunt General Hospital .  His most recent treatment was on
8/4/05 and his multiple myeloma seems to be responding well to
therapy. During this admission , multiple myeloma was not an
active issue. See Reb Memorial Hospital notes for more information.
Endocrine: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes , he
takes Lantus and Novolog at home. He was continued on these
medications while as an inpatient.
Pain: The patient was offered oxycodone p.r.n. for pain. He did
not complain of any pain during admission.
Psychiatric: The patient , though pleasant and cooperative on
admission , became increasingly combative. On the night of
1/5/05 , he became very combative , and attempted to hit one of
the cross covering physicians. The patient was initially tried
on several medications to control this agitation including Ativan
and Zyprexa. These apparently were not effective at first. The
patient continued to have difficulty sleeping and was very
agitated. At one point , he would not take his medications.
Psychiatry was involved , and after much discussion with the
patient and involvement of social work , the patient did calm down
and agreed to medical care. At one point when he became
agitated , he was given Haldol intravenously , in addition to
Ativan , after being given these medications , the patient slept
very well through the night. When he awoke the next morning , his
mood was much improved , and he apologized for his behavior ,
reporting he did not know what happened. Because of the change
in mental status , several studies were obtained to investigate
this , a head CT showed no acute disease , only some bony changes
likely chronic due to multiple myeloma. In addition , the
patient's electrolytes were checked which were normal , the
patient's fingerstick blood glucose was checked which was normal.
In addition , an RPR was sent , in addition to folate and B12.
These labs were pending at the time of discharge and will be
followed up by his outpatient physicians.

thinking clearly , and was pleasant and cooperative. The
remainder of the patient's exam was much improved from his
admission and his lower extremity edema had decreased to 1+ , and
