was 30. He presented to Dr. Oginski office today with complaints
of nausea and vomiting for 24-48 hours and mild abdominal pain , mid
epigastric. About two weeks ago , the patient developed upper
respiratory symptoms , cough , low grade temperature , malaise. The

holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex. Abdomen with mild
right upper quadrant tenderness/epigastric. Pulsatile liver ,
positive bowel sounds. Rectal refused. Extremities showed no

42.4 , platelets 240. PTT 30.6 , INR 3.1.
Urinalysis was pending. EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 123 ,
positive PVCs , left axis deviation , nonspecific T wave inversion
AVL , V5 , V6. Chest x-ray showed a very dilated heart , prominent
hila , increased PVR , no effusions. AICD lead seen in right
ventricle.
ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 1. Congestive heart failure. The patient has
clear evidence of left and right systolic
dysfunction. Patient with known cardiomyopathy , may have had
worsening of function with recent viral upper respiratory
infection. No clear dietary indiscretions. Begin Lasix drip ,
strict Is and Os , daily weights , low salt diet , cardiac monitor ,
check echo. 2. Abdominal pain. May have food poisoning on
Sunday. Also may have gastritis or pancreatitis. Right upper
quadrant pain may be secondary to congestive heart failure.
3. History of hypothyroidism. Check TSH.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Cardiomyopathy service , Dr. Jim Gerardot ,
attending , began following patient on the first
hospital day. It was felt that the Lasix drip was ineffective and
recommended starting 200 mg IV Lasix t.i.d. with the goal of
keeping the patient 1.5 to 2.5 liters negative per day. The
patient had difficulty with repletion of potassium during the
entire hospital stay. Patient does not tolerate well either the
immediate release oral form of potassium or the IV form. The IV
form hurts the IV site and the oral form makes him nauseous , but he
still prefers the oral form. Over the course of the admission , 10
mg p.o. twice daily of slow released potassium was started and ,
eventually , was 30 mg twice daily at the end of his stay.
Captopril was added to the regimen at 12.5 mg three times a day on
the second hospital day and was eventually raised to 50 mg three
times a day as his blood pressure tolerated , which took four days.
Creatinine remained stable throughout admission and did not affect
our ability to diurese with Lasix. After six days , the patient was
adequately diuresed. JVP was now not visible. Lungs were clear.
There was no edema. The patient is tolerating captopril well.
Coumadin , which had been 4 mg per day on admission , was cut to 2 mg
per day because of the high INR on admission. Two days prior to
discharge , INR fell to 1.9. Patient was restarted on 4 mg per day.
At discharge , INR was 1.7. Patient does not wish to stay to have
INR corrected. VNA has been arranged to administer Lovenox and to
check PT , PTT over the next few days until this normalizes to a
therapeutic level.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , digoxin 0.125
mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 160 mg p.o. q.a.m. ,
Prilosec 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q.d. , Compazine 10
mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. nausea.
Patient is being discharged home with VNA services. He will follow
up with Dr. Scottie Fowles on 11 of May at 9:20 A.M.
