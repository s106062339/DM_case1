BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
82 y.o. femalew tih long hx of hereditary angioedema- s/p multiple
remote prior tracheostomies due to airway edema- now admitted with lip
swelling. In recent years , her primary symptoms have been GI in
nature- with bowel swelling/ N/V/abdominal pain. Has been maintained
on stanazol previously , but on danazol for the last several years.
Patient had a recent admission for LGIB - outpatient elective
colonoscopy ultimately showed a stricture which was dilated. She had
persistent GI symptoms which were thought likely due to an angioedema
attack and her danazol was increased to 200 bid. In the last week ,
patient was in the midst of tapering this medication down with her
Allergist Dr. Petite , but has now developed upper lip swelling on day
of admission- which appeared to be worsening in the ED.
PMHx: notable for colonic strictures , DVT s/p IVC filter , ?DM , HTN ,
afib , CAD s/p MI , s/p sigmoid colostomy.
Long list of allergies including IV contrast , PCN , levaquin.
Meds include danazole 100 QD.
On exam , - afebrile , 99%ra , bp 105/80 , hr 80s. sitting up comfortably ,
able to speak with slightly muddled pronouncitation. Left upper lip
swelling to twice size of normal right side. No uvula swelling noted.
No stridor or increased secreations. Lungs clear. Irregular heart rate
with 3/6 HSM at LLSB. Faint crackles at bases. No rashes noted.
Labs remarkable only for Cr 1.2 ( basline ). Normal CBC , Normal coags.
C1Q/c4/c2/c1 esterase inhibitor results all pending.
Impression/Hospital course:
82 y.o. F with heriditary angioedema , presenting with lip swelling.
Patient was admitted to CCU for observation in case of airway
instability. She was treated with higher dose danazol ( 200 tid ) as well
as FFP ( for which she was premedicated with benadryl ). FFP replaces
C1 esterase inhibitor. She required single dose of IV lasix to maintain
I/O status during FFP infusion. She had rapid improvement over 24-48
hours with no signs of airway compromise. She will be followed closely
by her allergist and will leave on a higher dose of danazol. There is
some consideration of re-instituting stanazol in the future.
