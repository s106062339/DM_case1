Discharge Date: 10/16/2004
ATTENDING: MILFORD WIZWER M.D.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 36-year-old man with a history of a familial
cardiomyopathy , ejection fraction estimated at around 15% with
marked left and right chamber enlargement , severe mitral
regurgitation , tricuspid regurgitation , and PA pressures of 51
plus right atrium , as per an echo in 2003. He was also status
post ICD placement in 2001. At baseline , he has a one staircase
exercise tolerance before becoming short of breath. He also
admits that he has been having increasing orthopnea and
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He denies , chest pain ,
palpitations , or peripheral edema. He also has a history of
dietary fluid intake and medications noncompliance leading to
heart failure exacerbations. Currently , he states that he has
been eating "salty foods , " and has been drinking a lot of extra
fluids because he has been feeling dry and is not always taking
his medications. Consequently , he has noticed a worsening in his
exercise tolerance , worsening orthopnea , and most notably an
increase in abdominal girth. Because of these symptoms
consistent with decompensated heart failure , his physicians
suggested that he be admitted to the hospital for management of
his decompensated heart failure. Of note , he has been previously
on a transplant list , but has been delisted given his
noncompliance and continuation of tobacco use.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
In addition to the cardiomyopathy is chronic renal insufficiency
with the creatinine ranging from 1.2 to 3.5 at times.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Aldactone 25 mg once a day , K-Dur 40 mEq once a day , lisinopril
2.5 mg once a day , Isordil 20 mg three times a day , digoxin 0.125
once a day , torsemide 200 mg twice , and metolazone p.r.n. for
volume overload.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
As mentioned , he is smoking one-half per day of cigarettes ,
occasional alcohol use , no IV drug use.
FAMILY HISTORY:
His mother , his brother , and his cousin and nephew all have the
familial cardiomyopathy.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
On the day of admission , he presented with the JVP in the 18 to
20 range on the physical examination with positive HJR. His
cardiac exam had a positive S3 of laterally displaced PMI with
the right ventricular heave. He also had a 2/6 systolic murmur.
His abdomen was distended , nontender , but likely with ascites and
palpable liver edge. His extremities were warm without edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
From the cardiac standpoint , we initially attempted to diurese
him IV torsemide 200 mg b.i.d. However , he did not respond well
enough to this regimen , and therefore we started drip with
Zaroxolyn p.r.n. We also stopped his Isordil and ACE inhibitor
early on because of blood pressures in the 80s. On admission ,
his creatinine was 2.0 and on the next day of admission , it was
2.2 with low blood pressures , at which point , we decided to start
a low-dose dopamine drips at 2 mcg per hour. However , his urine
output was only about 500 cc negative , so we further increased
the Lasix drip from 10 mg an hour to 20 mg an hour after 200 mg
IV Lasix bolus. On this combination of the Lasix drip at 20 an
hour and dopamine at 2 mcg per hour , he began to have very good
and effective urine output at approximately 2-3 liters per day ,
negative , also reflected in his total weight , and came in with
admission weight of around 90 kg. On each day , he diuresed about
an half to kilo off until the day of discharge , at which point ,
he was less than 86 kg. We monitored strict I's and O's , checked
daily weight. During the course of his diuresis , his sodium
levels were decreasing mostly secondary to the patient drinking a
lot of free water. The combination of free water intake in the
setting of natriuresis resulted in further worsening of his
hyponatremia from an admission sodium of 128 to 124 , eventually
to 122. We strictly reinforce the need to limit his fluid intake
to less than 2 liters per day , and at that point , his sodium
levels than rebounded to 124 and also 128 on the day of
discharge. We monitored the b.i.d. lytes. Eventually , his blood
pressures remained stable. His JVP decreased from 18 to 20 on
admission to about 10 to 12 and continued to have good urine
output , thus we weaned off the dopamine , but continued the Lasix
drip for one more day. We then discontinued the Lasix drip and
transitioned him back over to torsemide 200 b.i.d. p.o. , which
was his home regimen and watch him for another 24 hours. He
continued to diurese at this dose , but then on the day of
discharge , his I's and O's were finally about 500 cc negative ,
which is a change from about 1 to 2 liters negative per day. His
JVP was about 9 to 10 and his creatinine was stable at 1.7. We
re-added his Isordil at 10 mg t.i.d. for the last 24 hours and
his blood pressures were stable in the 90s. Given his potassium ,
which was always borderline low in the 33 or 35 range , we decided
to increase his Aldactone dose to 25 mg b.i.d. , but given his
underlying renal insufficiency , we have decreased his standing
K-Dur from 40 mEq a day to 20 mEq a day. An echo was done , which
showed an ejection fraction of 20% and 4+ MR. They did not
comment on the synchrony on the preliminary report. However , he
is a candidate for Bi-V pacing given his mildly widened QRS
complex stage III heart failure and having been on a very good
heart failure regimen up until this point.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
At discharge , his medical regimen consisted of digoxin 0.125 mg
once a day , torsemide 200 mg b.i.d. , Aldactone 25 mg b.i.d. ,
Isordil 10 mg t.i.d. , and K-Dur 20 mEq. We also added folate 5
mg to his regimen because he had an elevated homocystine level.
He also takes Ambien at night p.r.n. for insomnia.
DISPOSITION:
He is being discharged to home with plan to follow up with Dr.
Grassi in her Thyroid Clinic on 3/1/05 .  He has been again urged
to stop smoking and to be complaint with his regimen because he
is a good heart transplant candidate and for the current time , he
is not listed given the aforementioned reasons. Overall , Mr.
Plagmann states that his symptoms have drastically improved. He
no longer has orthopnea. He is able to exert himself much more
without symptoms of shortness of breath or lightheadedness , and
he is eager to go home
