HPI:This is a 63 year-old female with history of CAD s/p MI and PCI
( stent to D1; see cardiac anatomy below ) , HTN , DM , hypercholesterolemia ,
obesity. She was last in her usual state of health approximately 1
month ago when she developed a "head cold" that has been marked by
frequent coughing and SOB/DOE. Her appetite has been quite poor , and she
reports occasional dizziness. She has been taking her diuretics
faithfully and has been making her usual UOP. She has not been using her
CPAP recently due to her head cold.
She awoke this morning feeling as if she were being choked. She reports
coughing quite violently and bringing up grayish/yellowish sputum
( no blood ). After her coughing spell , she became quite nauseated but
cannot remember if she threw up. She also developed some diffuse
chest tightness that lasted for approximately 10 minutes ,
associated with subjective fevers and diaphoresis. She returned to
sleep , but this time sitting up in her sofa. She reports that she has
been coughing throughout the day with 1 additional fleeting
episode of chest tightness this evening. She was CP-free upon
evaluation in the ED.
Of note , her presenting symptom during her NSTEMI back in '02 was low
back pain.

Review of Systems: As above. She further denies weight gain/loss , LE
edema , orthopnea , diarrhea , constipation , abdominal pain.

PCI ( stent D1 ) in '02 , HTN , DM , obesity who presents with atypical CP

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CV: Started on IV Heparin and Lipitor dose increased to 80mg. Cont'd
b-blocker and full dose aspirin. Pt was free of CP upon admission and
throughout admission. EKG remained at baseline abnormal but showed no
overt ischemic changes. Her first set of enzymes revealed a slightly
elevated CK 371 w/MB fraction of 3.7 , but all three troponins were
negative. Although her story was not convincing for ACS , her TIMI score=4
( known CAD , more than 2 episodes in last 24 h , previous ASA use , 3
cardiac RF's of HTN , DM , CHOL ).
MIBI nondiagnostic b/c of obesity. Pt did not tolerate cardiac PET on
8/17 , b/c of anxiety/claustraphobia , then refused to have study w/IVCS.
Given the fact that pt ruled out for MI , and that pain did not recur ,
team suspects CP may be related to cough ( M/S and/or pleuritic in
etiology ) and no further inpt CAD workup was pursued. Pt to f/u w/her
cardiologist 11/3 .
2. RENAL: new ARF likely secondary to taking home lasix in setting of
poor PO's , Cr improved to 1.4 after holding Cozaar and diuretics and
giving IVF. Pt instructed to restart Lasix and Cozaar on 7/18 .  Pt will
be followed by KOOTE HEALTH .  Wt upon admit=not recorded , wt upon d/c=258lbs.
3. PULM: Stable O2 sat and exercise tolerance on day of d/c. Sputum cx
grew mixed flora. Cont'd Advair , Albuterol , restarted nocturnal CPAP.
Tessalon ordered PRN.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: ATTN PATIENT:
1. if you develop recurrence of chest pain , worsening cough , difficulty
breathing , fever >101 , or any other symptoms that are worrisome to you
call your PCP or return to the ER for re-eval.
2. Keep records of your weight and blood sugars and bring the record to
your follow up appointments.
3. Bring your medications to your f/u cardiology appt for review by your
doctor.
ATTN VNA:
1. please reconcile home meds as pt was unable to clarify her pre-admit
meds during this admit and pt is essentially being discharged home on the
medications that were in the AMH computer system. if there are any
discrepancies w/available home meds in comparison to d/c med list then
notify pt's PCP.
2. daily CV and Pulm assessment ( including daily weights )
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
ATTN CARDIOLOGY: During f/u eval can you please review daily wts
and check a creatinine. Decide if diuretics and/or Cozaar needs
adjustment.
