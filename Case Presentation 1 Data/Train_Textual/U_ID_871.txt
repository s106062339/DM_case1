BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
*** 7/19 ***
7/9 78F w/ HTN , PAFon amiodarone , MS s/p MVR
on coumadin , ?CAD/IMI with clean coronaries on
cath '91 , h/o CHF , now presenting with 2 episodes
of ?syncope. First episode while sitting ,
?LOC , second episode while leaning over , likely no
LOC , both episodes without pre- or
post-syncopal SOB/palpitations/lightheadedness/confusion
or other sx. In ED had Lleg/armpain and HA.
Had negative Head CT , neg Lextremity films.
Meds noteable for extensive cardiac regimen
including lopressor , coumadin ,
amio , norvasc , lisinopril , lasix , isordil. CXR showed mild CHF
?Lbase effusion. ECHO 18 of January EF65% , EKG old inferior
MI changes/primary AVblock. Noted bradycardia to
30s while asleep on night of
admission CV: unclear etiology of syncopal episodes but
CV likely given her history. Will call Cards
consult in a.m. Important to assess specific
etiology given need for coumadin for MVR versus fall
risk with the syncopal episodes.Orthostatics
negative. Cardiology consulted , and recommended an event monitor to
assess for specific rhythms while she is symptomatic. Over her hospital
course , she had one episode of near-syncope similar to her weekend
symptoms. There was no typical rhythm noted on telemetry at that time.
Cardiology recommended monitoring HR and BP and consider d/c'ing
Lopressor if it is excessively low and correlating with symptoms.
Would follow up on event monitor to determine need for further
intervention.
Neuro: Head MR negative; ruled out intracranial
ischemia/bleed. Heme: INR 4.3 on admission and restarted after holding
for one day. Restarted coumadin at usual home dosing. On 7/10 INR was
2.1 so arranged for 4days of Lovenox to be given if INR is not
therapeutic.
Follow up plan: Event monitor to be ordered. Patient to follow up with
Dr. Bergerson and Dr. Gamma in 1-2 weeks. Visiting nurse to do home safety
eval , and monitor INR/administer Lovenox if needed , and check
BP/HR/symptoms.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: For visiting nurse: Please draw blood qd for 5 days to check INR. If it
is less than 2 please give the Lovenox injections for the day. If it
remains in 2-3 range , just continue the regular Coumadin dosing. Please
check BP and heart rate and call primary doctor Dr. Mickles if it is
excessively low or high and patient is complaining of symptoms. Please
ensure she is wearing her event monitor.
