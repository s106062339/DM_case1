HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating room as
described above. He was stabilized in the PACU and transferred
to the regular floor for a routine postoperative care. He was
given an epidural for pain control as well as IV Lopressor for
perioperative beta blockade while the patient was n.p.o. He was
given supplemental oxygen and was weaned as tolerated. The
patient was placed on the colectomy pathway postoperatively and
his NG tube was removed in the morning on postoperative day #1.
He was advanced to sips with no nausea or vomiting. He had a
Blake drain in his pelvis and that was left initially postop
until the output decreased. His Foley and left ureteral stent
were in place for two days and then his JP drain was sent for
creatinine analysis to look for a ureteral leak. This was found
to be negative for leak and his JP drain was subsequently
removed. The patient was given subcutaneous heparin for DVT
prophylaxis and he was given Ancef and Flagyl x2 two doses
perioperatively as well as his home HIV meds.
The patient initially had an uneventful postoperative course and
was tolerating a house diet and had adequate ostomy output with
no nausea or vomiting by postop day #3. However , by
postoperative #5 , the patient's abdomen was more distended and he
had increasing nausea with any type of food by mouth. A KUB was
obtained at that time which was consistent with ileus. The
patient was switched back to clear liquids until his ostomy began
to function once again. He was given IV fluids for continued
hydration at that time. By postoperative day #7 , the patient's
ileus had resolved and he was passing gas and stool into his bag.
However , the output from his bag was greater than 1200 mL per
day. The Metamucil was added as well as Imodium to decrease the
output of his ostomy. By postop day #7 , in addition to his high
ostomy output , the patient had sinus tachycardia approximately
110 beats per minute. His Lopressor was increased to 20 mg q.4h.
for increased blood pressure control , and heart rate control. By
postoperative day #8 , his heart rate was 80s to 90s and blood
pressure was 120s/70s. His ostomy continued to put out greater
than 3 to 4 L over the course of next few days. During this
time , the patient was tolerating a regular diet with no nausea or
vomiting , but his stools were increasingly liquid and high
output. His fluid loss was supplemented with LR in a 1:1 fashion
to of avoid dehydration. By postoperative day #11 , the patient's
ostomy continued approximately 4 L and a tincture of opium was
begun as a the third line agent to decrease the ostomy output.
This decreased ostomy output to approximately 1 L and the patient
symptomatically was improving and feeling good. He was
tolerating a regular diet with no nausea and no vomiting. His
pain was well controlled on p.o. pain meds , and the patient
stated that he would be able to keep himself well hydrated on
discharge.
