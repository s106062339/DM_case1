Discharge Date: 5/21/1996
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
OTHER PROBLEMS: 1. Poorly controlled hypertension.
2. Diabetes.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Fjeseth is a 62-year-old woman with
cardiac risk factors of hypertension ,
diabetes , a positive family history , and coronary disease
documented by a prior myocardial infarction who presented with
increased leg swelling , a 21 lb weight gain over the last three
months and who was seen in Clinic on February , 1996 , by Dr.
Glod , and was admitted for management. She had a myocardial
infarction in 1981 and , in September 1995 , she had a three vessel CABG
which included a LIMA graft to the LAD and two saphenous vein
grafts to the OM and to the PDA. In April 1995 , her postoperative
course had been complicated by loculated left pleural effusion
which required bronchoscopy and a left thoracentesis , as well as a
thorascopic lysis of pleural adhesions , some decortication and
drainage of effusions. At this time , she had also been dyspneic on
exertion along with shortness of breath at rest. On April , 1995 ,
she had an echo which showed an EF of 59% , a mildly dilated left
ventricle , abnormal septal motion secondary to left bundle branch
block , and minimal mitral regurgitation , and mild mitral
calcification above the normal right ventricular size and function.
A Bovie study was also performed and was negative. She also
presented with some biventricular failure and diuresis was
attempted , as well as alkaloid reduction. Over the past two
months , she had increased lower extremity edema , and she gained
approximately 21 lb since February , 1995. She has been quite
active and not limited. However , the edema has been her most
limiting factor. Three nights prior to admission , she had dyspnea
on exertion and some proximal maximal dyspnea , but she had no chest
pain and compression boots were attempted to try to alleviate some
of the edema. She had no orthopnea. She claims to have no dietary
indiscretions , no fevers , no sweats , no chills , no coughs , no chest
pain , no abdominal pain , and no bright red blood per rectum , but
she was more fatigued. On February , 1996 , she was seen in Clinic
by Dr. Denet and was seen to have increased leg edema and
increased dyspnea on exertion with climbing stairs. An echo was
performed and showed decreased left ventricular function within an
EF of about 40% , decreased down from an EF of 59% documented in
April 1995. Her CKs were flat an troponin I level later documented
0.4 , which was negative. Echo report also showed some inferior
posterior hypokinesis , as well as significant tricuspid
insufficiency at 3.2 meters per second , which suggested PA
pressures of about 41 mmHg. The patient was subsequently admitted
for management of her congestive heart failure.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , status post
myocardial infarction in 1981 , hypertension
with systolics in the 200s , which has been difficult to control ,
diabetes for which she has been on insulin. She has a history of
an amaurosis fugax in September 1995 and was started on Coumadin in January
1995. She has a history of the loculated pleural effusions and a
history of TIA while being on Coumadin. She also has a history of
kidney stones.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: CABG times three in 1995 , right CEA in
1993 , and right mastoid surgery.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin and Ceclor which cause a rash.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Lopressor 50 mg p.o. q.i.d. , Coumadin 2.5
mg p.o. q.h.s. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. ,
Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , insulin NPH
35 units q.a.m. , Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Procardia XL 30 mg p.o.
p.r.n. , and Slow KCl.
FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for mother who had a myocardial
infarction at age 40 and 60. Father died of a
myocardial infarction at age 40.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a rather obese woman ,
totally edematous , who was slightly short of
breath while talking. Her vitals were 97.3 , 64 , blood pressure
211/100 , respiration rate 20 , and oxygen saturation of 96% on room
air. Her neck examination was significant for a jugular venous
pulse that went up to the angle of her jaw at 30 degrees. Her
carotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally showing no bruits , but there was
a right CEA scar. Her chest examination was significant for few
crackles at bilateral bases. Cardiac examination showed a normal
S1 , S2 , but with a faint S3. Abdominal examination had a positive
fluid wave , positive bowel signs , and she was tender in right upper
quadrant. Extremities showed 3+ pitting edema to knees
bilaterally. DP pulse was 1+ bilaterally and femoral pulses were
unable to be palpated. Her weight , at the time of admission , was
233 lb.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory values were unremarkable at the time
of admission. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm of
64 , left bundle branch block , and there was no change essentially
since September 1995. Chest x-ray , on admission , showed increased
interstitial markings bilaterally with perhaps a slight pleural
effusion. There was also some left lower lobe scarring and there
was an elevated left hemidiaphragm , which was consistent with
increased initial pulmonary edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was diuresed with IV Lasix for the
first three hospital days , during which she lost
approximately 17 lb. She was then switched to p.o. Lasix on
hospital day four , and continued to diurese. She was placed on
strict fluid and diet restrictions throughout her stay. Her blood
pressure was controlled with a diuretic , as well as with a beta-1
blocker and ACE inhibitor and a small amount of nitrate. Her
calcium blocker was discontinued while we were trying to diurese
her. Her blood sugars ran low with her normal 35 units of NPH
dose , so the dose was held for a couple days and she was controlled
an CZI sliding scale and was resumed on 20 units of NPH. By
hospital day five , the patient was stable on the staple regimen.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 100 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , NPH 20 units subcutaneous
q.a.m. , Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lopressor 50 mg p.o. q.6h. ,
nitroglycerin NTG 1/150 sublingual q.5 minutes times three p.r.n.
chest pain , Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. ,
Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , KCl slow release 32 mEq p.o. b.i.d. ,
ofloxacin 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. times three days.
COMPLICATIONS: The patient had irritation of her bladder from her
Foley catheter and produced some bloody urine and
then upon discontinuing the Foley catheter had some burning of her
urine for which a urinalysis was performed. She was placed on
ofloxacin for three days.
DISPOSITION: The patient was stable upon discharge.
FOLLOW-UP: She is to follow up with Dr. Mancha on January ,
1996 at 12:30 p.m. during a scheduled appointment. She
is also to follow up with Kelley Tallie , her nurse at Ver Hospital to
follow up on her blood sugar control. The patient will also have a
VNA sent to see her three times a week for vital signs check ,
weight medical , pharmaceutical compliance , and her weights will be
called in to Dr. Heglar She should also improve upon her
physical therapy and increase her abilities for ambulation.
