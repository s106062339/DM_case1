HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Wolcott is a 42-year-old
gentleman who underwent multiple
procedures on his right knee , who presents for right knee
autologous chondrocyte implantation for a right knee medial femoral
condyle defect. He also presents for an anteromedialization of the
tibial tubercle for patellofemoral maltracking.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: His past medical history is notable for
glomerulonephritis with chronic renal
insufficiency , for renal induced hypertension , for insomnia , for
asthma , and for gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: His past surgical history is notable for
gastric bypass surgery , as well as a
perianal abscess that was treated with IV antibiotics , left knee

SOCIAL HISTORY: He lives with his family , he is engaged and works

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Exam of his right knee shows that his
incisions are well-healed. There is a mild
effusion. Neurologic exam was intact. He had tenderness over the
medial femoral condyle.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 3/5 For
details of the procedure he underwent , please see
the operative note. In brief , a chondral defect of his right knee
and patellofemoral maltracking were noted. He then subsequently
underwent a decompression of his patellofemoral joint via a 4%
Fulkerson procedure. He also underwent autologous chondrocyte
implantation to his right knee medial femoral condyle defects. He
tolerated this procedure well. Postoperatively his neurovascular
status of his limb remained intact. A drain was left in place , and
care was taken to evaluate for compartment syndrome. No
compartment syndrome did develop. He did receive Coumadin
anticoagulation for DVT prophylaxis. He received perioperative
antibiotics. It was noted that the lateral skin flap over his
anterior knee wound was erythematous and he was restarted on Keflex
after his IV antibiotics were discontinued. His postoperative
course was notable for a worsening and acute onset of renal failure
on top of his chronic renal insufficiency. He was evaluated very
closely and followed by the Renal Consult Service. His creatinine
did rise from a baseline of around 4 up to 6.7. At the time of
discharge , his creatinine had begun to fall and his renal status
had stabilized.
He was seen by Physical Therapy , and he was placed in a continuous
passive motion machine to maintain knee motion. He was ambulated
touch down weightbearing on his right leg. He was to undergo no
active extension of his right knee. He was ready for discharge on
10/28/01. Discharge condition stable.
