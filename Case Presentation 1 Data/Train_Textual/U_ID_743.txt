ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Your chest pain was not a heart attack , and is more likely to repsresent
dyspepsia/esophageal reflux than any cardiac disease , and we have given
you a trial of medicine for this , you should also try elevating the head
of your bed and avoiding onions , alcohol , and fatty foods. You do have a
new diagnosis of diabetes , high blood pressure , and high cholesterol ,
however , and are at risk for heart disease , so we have started you on a
regimen of diabetes , blood pressure , and cholesterol reducing medicines ,
and it is important to follow up with your primary care physician.
