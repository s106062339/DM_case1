Discharge Date: 7/11/2004
ATTENDING: FREDRIC HILARIO MALICK MD
SERVICE: Vascular Surgery Service.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 61-year-old female with a
complicated past medical history notable for CVA and peripheral
vascular disease with chronic nonhealing foot ulcers. Patient
was seen a week prior to her current admission in Vascular Clinic
for evaluation of nonhealing ulcers of the right foot and was
subsequently scheduled for a right lower extremity angiogram with
subsequent debridement planned shortly thereafter. Two days
prior to admission , however , the staff at her rehabilitation
facility noted increasing erythema in the area of her ulcer
associated with increased complaints of pain from the patient.
Patient was subsequently referred to Alstead Medical Emergency Department for further evaluation and
management on 10/5/2004 .

ALLERGIES: Sulfa. Question of allergy to Levaquin.
Questionable history of adverse reactions to Prozac , trazodone ,
baclofen , and narcotics.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Patient previously lived with husband. Patient
has been wheelchair-dependent for the past four weeks due to her
chronic ulcers. Smokes 1-2 packs per day until approximately
four weeks prior to admission.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT: Afebrile.
Heart rate 66 , blood pressure 110/48 , breathing 18 , satting 98%
on room air. Patient was noted to be in moderate distress
secondary to discomfort of her right lower extremity with
associated spasm and foot pain. Patient's lungs were noted to be
clear to auscultation bilaterally. A well-healed right CEA scar
was noted on the patient's neck. Patient's heart was noted to
have a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or gallops.
Patient's abdomen was noted to be soft , nondistended and
nontender. Extremity exam demonstrated a right leg with severe
knee contracture and spasm. The left side was noted to be
normal. The left foot was noted to have two small clean ulcers ,
one on the medial bunion and one on the tip of the medial great
toe. The right foot was noted to have a large dark necrotic
pressure wound on the lateral aspect and plantar aspect of the
mid foot , an open infected-appearing ulcer was noted on the
medial forefoot with surrounding erythema and a greenish exudate
of film. Pulse exam demonstrated 2+ pulses in bilateral
carotids , radials , and femorals. Right popliteal biphasic
Doppler pulses noted. No pulses were able to be distinguished in
the right foot. The left foot was noted to have biphasic signals
in the DP and PT by Doppler.
LABORATORY STUDIES UPON ADMISSION: Sodium 136 , potassium 4.8 ,
chloride 101 , bicarbonate 23 , BUN 21 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 74.
ALT was 36 , AST 33 , alk phos 173 , total bili 0.3 , albumin 4.0.
White blood cell count was 9.6 , hematocrit 36.2 , and platelets
232. PT 13.4 , PTT 28.1 , INR 1.0. Chest x-ray demonstrated a
mild interstitial disease with multiple old right rib fractures.
X-ray of the feet demonstrated bilateral osteopenia with no
evidence of osteomyelitis in either foot. EKG was noted to be
normal with a normal sinus rhythm at 63.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted to the Vascular Surgery
Service on 10/5/2004 for further evaluation and management. She
was empirically started on vancomycin and ceftazidime with
wet-to-dry dressings applied to her right foot wound. The
patient was also continued on her prior dose of Macrobid for
previously-diagnosed UTI with her antibiotic regimen to be
discontinued for this purpose on 9/8/2004 .  An angiogram
performed on hospital day #2 , revealed a right external iliac
occlusion which was stented near the bifurcation of the internal
and external iliac vessels. A distal stenosis of the external
iliac was opened with balloon angioplasty to good effect. The
patient sustained a mild groin hematoma on the left at the access
site but had no change in her pulse exam there afterwards.
Following her angiogram and percutaneous intervention , the
patient was noted to demonstrate excellent right lower extremity
DP and PT pulses which remained palpable through the duration of
her hospital course. On hospital day #3 , the patient was brought
to the operating room for debridement of her right foot. For a
detailed description of the patient's operative procedure , please
the relevant operative note. Patient tolerated the procedure
well and during the procedure , the patient's ulcer base was found
to be contiguous with the first metatarsal head periosteum , and
therefore , a metatarsal head excision was performed. The
patient's great toe was left in place with moderate debridement
of the deep tissues. The ulcers on the lateral right foot were
not debrided at this time. Following her procedure , the patient
was empirically continued on vancomycin and ceftazidime. Her
operative cultures subsequently grew out coagulase-negative staph
which was sensitive to both Keflex and vancomycin. At this
point , the patient was switched to vancomycin therapy only and
was continued on VAC therapy through postoperative day #3. At
this point , the patient's VAC dressing was changed to demonstrate
a well-vascularized actively bleeding wound with granulation
tissue and no signs of wound necrosis. The patient remained in
stable condition through postoperative day #7 at which point , she
was returned to the operating room for a great toe amputation and
definitive closure of her right foot wound. For a detailed
description of this operative procedure , please see the relevant
operative note. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was
subsequently returned to the Regular Outpatient Floor where she
remained for the duration of her stay. A general overview of the
patient's hospital course by system is as follows:
1. Neurological: The patient demonstrated significant issues
with pain control for the duration of her stay. A fair amount of
her pain was determined to be secondary to her right foot ulcer;
however , the patient was also noted to have significant pain
associated with her contracted right lower extremity. For a
time , the patient was placed in a right lower extremity extension
brace which provided some measure of relief; however , upon
regular examination of her right lower extremity , it was noted
that she was gradually developing pressure ulcers secondary to
the extension brace. A Neurology and Pain Service consultation
was obtained and the patient was subsequently recommended for
Zanaflex therapy which subsequently improved her pain control
dramatically. The patient otherwise remained intact from a
neurological perspective for the duration of her stay ,
demonstrating frequent emotional ability consistent with her
baseline examination.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient remained stable from a
cardiovascular perspective for the duration of her stay with no
evidence of acute hemodynamic instability or compromise. At no
point did she demonstrate evidence of acute myocardial ischemia
or infarction.
3. Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary
perspective for the duration of her stay with no evidence of
acute respiratory decompensation.
4. GI: The patient remained stable from a gastrointestinal
standpoint for the duration of her stay and was noted to be
tolerant of both solid and liquid oral intake. Upon discharge ,
she was noted to be tolerant of both solid and liquid p.o. intake
and was noted to be independently productive of adequate amounts
of stool and flatus.
5. GU: As described previously , the patient was admitted with a
known diagnosis of a urinary tract infection. She was continued
on Macrobid therapy through 9/8/2004 , at which point this
therapy was discontinued. Subsequent follow-up urinalyses
demonstrated no further evidence of urinary tract infection.
Upon completion of her Macrobid antibiotic course , the patient's
Foley catheter was removed and she was noted to be independently
productive of adequate amounts of urine for the duration of her
stay. She at no point demonstrated any evidence of acute renal
compromise or electrolyte imbalance.
6. Heme: The patient remained stable with a stable hematocrit
for the duration of her stay. She was started on Plavix therapy
following her angiogram , on which she remains at the time of her
discharge. DVT prophylaxis was provided via subcutaneous heparin
for the duration of her stay.
7. ID: As stated above , the patient's operative cultures were
noted to grow coag.-negative staph , sensitive to both vancomycin
and Keflex. For the majority of her stay , the patient remained
on vancomycin therapy but was transitioned to Keflex on
1/11/2004 , on which she remained for the duration of her stay.
At the time of discharge , the patient has been instructed to
complete an additional 10-day course of Keflex therapy. Of note ,
the patient remained afebrile with a stable white count for the
duration of her stay and her wound exam demonstrated no evidence
of further infection at the ulcer site.
8. Endocrine: The patient maintained adequately well-controlled
blood sugars for the duration of her stay with no evidence of
acute endocrinological compromise. The patient was subsequently
cleared for discharge to a rehabilitation facility on
postoperative days 10 and 3 , 7/11/2004 , with instructions for
follow up.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Patient is to be discharged to a
rehabilitation facility with instructions for follow up.
