**Hospital Course**
CV/HEME:
Patient underwent cardiac cath on 6/28/04 - LAD 90% lesion and OM2 99%
lesion both successfully stented with cypher. Remaining 100% PDA.
Following cath , patient had bradycardia to 20-30's in setting of
femoral hematoma. BP initially measured in 60s , thought to be vagal 2/2
femoral hematoma. Received atropine x 1 and Fem stop placed over cath
site for compression - BP dropped again with bradycardia- transferred
to CCU and briefly on dopamine. CT ruled out retroperitoneal
bleed. Hct stable. Transferred back to floor within 24 hours.
Patient also noted occasional mild abdominal discomfort , but had
negative LFTs and lipase. She also noted right calf pain and was found
to have a below-the knee right tibial vein DVT , was not anticoagulated
for this below-the knee clot because of low risk of embolization and he
r recent HCT drop/hematoma. LENI was repeated on day of discharge
and showed no progression. One the two days prior to admission ,
her HCT dropped from 32 to 26 , and she was trandfused 2 U PRBC
w/HCT bump to 34.1. Repeat CT showed shrinkage of hematoma , so
pt is being discharged with plans to have PCP recheck HCT at home
in 2 days.
MSK: Patient complained of left knee pain after fall one week prior.
X-ray shoed only osteoarthritis , although knee was somewhat warm.
There was no clear effusion , so patient is being given
ibuprofen PRN for now.
______
Anti-ischemic regimen at discharge: ASA , Plavix , Atenolol , Lisinopril.
( no Statin because of muscle pain hx ). Will continue home diabetic
regimen and followup with PCP/cardiology.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You should return to the hospital or call your doctor if you have chest
pain or difficulty breathing.
Dr. Estrello 's office will send someone to your home on Sunday 8/17 to
draw your blood levels. Your hematocrit on discharge today is 34.1
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
You should have a repeat right leg ultrasound test ( "LENI" ) to follow
the small blood clot in your leg. You will need to schedule this test
to occur in the next 3-4 weeks through Dr. Gino Onisick office.
