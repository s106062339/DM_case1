BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC:Left Lower Chest Pain
HPI: 68 yo man with h/o DM HTN hyperlipidemia , asthma presented to

time. At home he self-measured SBP to be 236 systolic ( baseline SBP at home
is 160-180 ). Pt admitted that he had not taken BP meds for several days.
Chest pain was reproducible on chest palpation. Initial biomarkers: TnI
0.11 , CK 232 , MB 1.9. In ED started on heparin , lopressor ( 5mg IV , 25mg
PO ) , ASA 325. No relief from TNG gtt , relief from morphine sulfate.
Cardiac risk factors: DM , +dislipidemia , +family hx heart disease. No tob
use.

HOSPITAL COURSE: Pt is 68 yo male admitted with troponin+ ACS ,
hypertensive urgency , and chest wall pain reprocducible upon palpation.
Stent placed L circumflex.
1. CV: Ischemia: Despite chest pain reproducible on palpation , pt did
have mildly elevated biomarkers. Started on Heparin , IV lopressor+25mg PO
lopressor , given ASA 325. Went for cath 5/21 , found to have 3VD: 100%
occlusion R coronary ( small vessel , L dom heart ); 85% occlusion of L. cx--1x
cypher stent placed , restored to 100% with TIMI3 flow. Also 35% lesion
proximal LAD and 80% occ mid-apical LAD ( not stented ). Loaded with 600mg
plavix. Will need to continue on 75mg plavix for >1yr , continue 325mg ASA.
Started on Zocor at 40 , will increase to 60mg QD at discharge. Pt had LDL 77
with low HDL , PCP will follow lipid panel , decision to treat with niacin vs
fenofibrate will be deferred to PCP who will f/u within 1wk of discharge. Pt
will also need f/u ETT to eval any residual ischemic disease and need of
intervention in distal LAD lesion ( this test and f/u cardiology appointment
will be arranged by BC cardiology for about 2wks after discharge ). Pt also
d/c on 25mg Toprol XL and 40mg lisinopril , rx for SL nitro given.
Pump: Echo revealed EF 60% , no regional wall motion abnormality , mild LVH ,
mild TR+MR ( unchanged from 2002 ). Pt has history of severe htn. CCb d/c'd ,
pt started on lopressor 12.5 BID ( d/c'd on 25mg toprol ). Cont HCTZ 25 QD ,
lisinopril 40mg daily. SBP elevated to 160 day of discharge , further
changes in regimen deferred for adjustment by PCP who should follow closely.
Given low HR , may consider restart of CCb rather than uptitration or toprol.
Rhythm: Pt had 25 beat run of asymptomatic VT in setting of ischemia prior to
cath , no events 24hr prior to d/c ( occ PVC couplets ). On beta-blocker ,
PCP should follow lytes after d/c.
2. ENDO: Pt with poorly-controlled DM. On NPH BID plus Aspart AC+HS during
hospital stay , will discharge on home regimen of insulin , needs f/u with
PCP.
3.Pulm: History of asthma , wheezing during hospital stay improved on
advair. Will continue 500/50mg 1puff BID for now , PCP should address need
for continued treatment.
4.GI. Started on 20mg nexium given treatment with 325mg ASA , PCP should
evaluate if continued treatment needed.

lipids ( need for fenofibrate vs nicacin , adjustment of statin ).
Optimization of insulin regimen. Also , need to re-evaluate asthma
regimen.
--F/u ETT and office visit with PHO cardiology who will address need for
further revascularization of LAD lesions.
