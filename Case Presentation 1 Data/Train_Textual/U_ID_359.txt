Discharge Date: 4/3/2004
ATTENDING: BOYD ENOCH GROTELUESCHEN M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: Dizziness , blurred vision.
LIST OF OTHER DIAGNOSES: Congestive heart failure , coronary
artery disease , diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and glaucoma.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This patient is a 56-year-old man
with known coronary disease , congestive heart failure , and
diabetes mellitus , presenting with an episode of weakness and
blurry vision. The patient had a recent admission at Doyle Health Care Services 7/20/04 through 10/17/04 with malignant
hypertension and CHF. At that time , he had 3+ lower extremity
edema , a BNP of 1374 , and an ejection fraction of 20%. On echo ,
he was diuresed and lost 10 kg of fluid and was discharged to
follow up with the CHF Service. Since that time , he has been
maintained on 60 mg p.o. of Lasix , recently increased to 60 mg
b.i.d. , also with some recent increases in his Toprol XL and
amlodipine. The patient presented to the emergency department on
the day of admission with an episode of weakness and blurred
vision. He states that he was at work helping set up for a party
and he became somewhat week. His vision blurred and this
resolved when he sat down to rest. He reports having had one
similar episode approximately one month ago , for which he did not
seek medical care. He had no chest pain , no palpitations , no
shortness of breath , no fever or chills at home and in the days
prior to the episode had had good appetite and no complaints of
dysuria.
In the emergency department , his vitals were temperature 97.1 ,
pulse 70 , and blood pressure 147/68. The patient was
comfortable. An EKG revealed a question of ST changes and it was
noted that his creatinine was increased to 2.1 from his baseline
of 1.4 and then his blood glucose was 307. He was admitted in
order to rule out myocardial infarction.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes , coronary artery disease ,
congestive heart failure , hypertension , cognitive deficits , and
glaucoma.
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION: Amlodipine 7.5 mg ,
Timoptic 0.5 one drop OU q.d. , aspirin 81 mg q.d. , Imdur 120 mg
q.d. , Zestril 50 mg q.d. , Toprol XL 150 mg q.d. , Lasix 60 mg
b.i.d. , glipizide XL 10 mg q.d. , and atorvastatin 40 mg q.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Notable for the fact that the patient lives with
his mother and works at Ondo Carmi Medical Center Cafeteria.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Notable for vitals as above.
The patient's jugular venous pulsations were visible at less than
10 cm. His heart was regular with S1 , S2 , S4 , and no murmurs.
His lungs had bibasilar crackles , right greater than left. His
abdomen was soft , nontender. No hepatosplenomegaly. His
extremities were notable for no edema. Scattered excoriations
with quite long nails.
LABS AT ADMISSION: Notable for a potassium of 5.3 , blood glucose
of 307 , creatinine of 2.1 , white blood count of 7 , and hematocrit
of 42. BNP was 118. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 62 , left
atrial enlargement , left ventricular hypertrophy , and T-wave
inversions with ST changes in I , II , and V1 through V5. Chest
x-ray showed stable cardiomegaly.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient ruled out for MI. He had no
complaints of chest pain at any time during his admission.
Initially , his Lasix and lisinopril were held in the context of
concern over possible hypotension as an etiology of his episode
of weakness. However , these were restarted on the second
hospital day at slightly diminished doses compared to his
baseline.
2. Renal: The patient's creatinine improved and at the time of
discharge , it was back to his baseline of 1.5.
3. Endocrine: The patient's diabetes mellitus is very poorly
controlled. At present , his hemoglobin A1c measured at admission
was 11.4 indicating an average blood glucose level of greater
than 300. While in-house , he continued to receive his baseline
dose of glipizide XL , however , he was also covered with regular
insulin on a sliding scale. The patient has no prior history of
insulin use at home. After consideration of the risks and
benefits of other oral agents including the high nature of his
hemoglobin A1c , it was decided that insulin therapy would be
necessary for adequate control of his diabetes. Various concern
over the patient's ability to successfully manage insulin therapy
at home and so , a simply regimen was selected. To begin with , he
was discharged on standing dose of 6 units of NPH in the morning
and 6 units at bedtime to be given via a prefilled disposable
insulin pen that will involve no need to draw up the medication
himself , but simply to select the correct dose and give the
injection.
4. Neuro: The patient's episode of blurred vision did not
recur. It is possible that his hyperglycemia accounted for this.
He did have an ophthalmologic exam one week prior to admission
that revealed no problems. He had no other neurologic or visual
symptoms during his stay in the hospital.
5. Fluid , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient was somewhat
hyperkalemic at admission with a potassium of 5.3. This resolved
with a single dose of Kayexalate and his potassium returned to
normal levels. The patient was discharged in stable condition on
6/19/04 .  To receive close followup , he will have visiting
nurses' visits including two visits the day after discharge in
order to assist with insulin management and he has an appointment
with his primary care physician , Dr. Clifford Evanko , the day after
discharge on 5/6/04 .
MEDICATIONS AT DISCHARGE: Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Timoptic 0.5% one drop
OU b.i.d. , Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Imdur 120 mg p.o. q.d. ,
glipizide XL 10 mg p.o. q.d. , atorvastatin 40 mg p.o. q.d. ,
