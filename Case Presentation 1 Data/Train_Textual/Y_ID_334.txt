5. Hypertension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 61-year-old female with a
past medical history significant for CHF exacerbations , dilated
cardiomyopathy with an EF of 25-30% , history of depression ,

loss. Of note , the patient was recently admitted overnight on
3/3/2006 , with similar complaints. In the ED , the patient
complained of abdominal pain , which reportedly is chronic. Pain
is thought to be related to keloids at the sites of her open

CAT scan of her abdomen done on her last admission on 6/2/06 ,
which showed diffuse micronodular opacities with wide ranging
differential diagnosis including infectious colitis , lymphoma , or
mastocytosis. A colonoscopy is recommended for further
evaluation. The patient was admitted to the hospital for control
of her shortness of breath , which was related to CHF exacerbation.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient's shortness of breath was
attributed to her CHF , and the patient was treated with Lasix 80
mg IV b.i.d. with a goal of greater than 1 liter negative per
day. The patient's weight was monitored daily. On admission , it
was 180.4 pounds and on discharge , it was 167 pounds. The

to 1.3 on 4/18/2006 , but then on discharge , it went back down to
1.1. The patient was discharged home on her usual home dose of
Lasix , which is 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. The patient's ambulating O2
saturation was 99% on room air. The patient did have some
intermittent episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
She remained asymptomatic. Her electrolytes were repleted
aggressively and the patient's metoprolol was increased from 12.5
mg to 25 mg t.i.d. As a result , the patient was sent home on
Toprol 75 mg daily instead of her prior home dose of 50 mg daily.
The patient had cardiac enzymes checked because of her
intermittent episodes of NSVT. The patient's troponin was less
than assay. She was continued on aspirin , spironolactone ,
lisinopril , Imdur , Zocor , and Cozaar. The patient also has
outpatient appointments with cardiology in the CHF clinic.
2. GI: The patient has a history of chronic abdominal pain and
a history of ischemic colitis. Pain during this admission was
similar to previous pain. On exam , the patient was diffusely

colonoscopy. The patient's primary care physician was notified

headaches and migraines , and she had a persistent headache during

hypochromia by RBC indices , which were suggestive of iron
deficiency anemia. She was continued on her iron
supplementation.
