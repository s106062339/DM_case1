Discharge Date: 8/27/1999
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 68 year old gentleman
who has a past medical history of
non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , coronary artery disease ,
and peripheral vascular disease who had a revascularization
procedure with a left femoral popliteal bypass graft in August of
1998. Since that time his foot has become cool and the graft has
been noted to be occluded. He presents for a re-operation for
revascularization.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary
artery bypass graft in 1991 and series of angioplasties prior to
the coronary artery bypass graft. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Non-healing left foot ulcer with no osteomyelitis. Hypertension.
Peripheral vascular disease.
MEDICATIONS: Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.a.m. , Glucophage 850 mg p.o.
t.i.d. , Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 50 mg
p.o. q.d. , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Simvastatin 10
mg p.o. q.d. , and NPH 10 units subcu q.p.m.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: In 1991 he had a coronary artery bypass
graft. His postoperative course was
complicated only by atrial fibrillation which was medically managed
and he has been without recurrence since that time. In August of
1998 he had a left superficial femoral artery to anterior tibial
artery bypass graft with non-reversed greater saphenous vein and
left common femoral endarterectomy with Dacron patch angioplasty ,
as well as debridement of the left lateral foot wound. After this
surgery , he had an uncomplicated postoperative course.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient quit smoking in the fall of 1998 and
does not use alcohol.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He has had no chest pain , shortness of breath ,
or angina since the time of his bypass. Just
prior to his admission , he was seen by Dr. Frankie Krampitz of Harlsti Conon Memorial Medical Center cardiology and was cleared from a cardiac
standpoint saying that he was an average risk for surgery as he has
done well from his prior surgeries and has had no symptoms since
his bypass surgery. Additionally , his preoperative angiogram
showed his superficial femoral artery graft to be proximally
occluded with mid to distal reconstitution. Above the knee
popliteal artery , there was mild diffuse disease. Below the knee
popliteal was patent. There was diffuse proximal disease in the
peroneal and posterior tibial arteries. The posterior tibial
occludes above the knee and there is high grade focal stenosis at
the anterior tibial origin. The dorsalis pedis is patent.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On 2/10/99 the patient was brought to the
operating room where Dr. Moises performed a left
femoral above-the-knee popliteal bypass graft. This went without
complications. The type of graft used as a 6 mm Dalcron graft.
The immediate postoperative pulse examination was notable for a
palpable femoral popliteal and graft pulse with a Dopplerable
dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulse on left side. The
patient had an ECG postoperatively that showed no significant
change to his preoperative ECG. He was started on heparin at 8
p.m. the day of surgery.
Of note , on postoperative day #1 , the patient got very diaphoretic
and nauseous. At that time an ECG was done that showed no
significant change and , throughout that episode , he had no
hemodynamic instability. This was likely secondary to having
gotten up rather quickly and likely a vasovagal event.
Throughout the rest of his hospitalization course the patient was
mobilized with physical therapy. He had a Dopplerable dorsalis
pedis pulse , posterior tibial pulse , and peroneal pulse on left
side throughout his entire hospital course. However , the graft was
no longer palpable by postoperative day #2 but it was strongly
Dopplerable.
The patient was continued on heparin until his Coumadin reached the
high 1 level which was achieved on 1/25/99 when his INR was 1.6. At
this time his heparin was discontinued. The anticoagulation is on
for keeping the graft patent and not for any cardiac or stroke
reasons. The goal on his INR will be approximately 2 to 2.5. On
1/25/99 the patient was stable for discharge. His pulse examination
was notable for Dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior
tibial pulse and peroneal pulse.
The patient's record of Coumadin in response with INR is as
follows: On 2/10/99 the patient was started on Coumadin at which
point his INR was 1.0. On that day he got 5 mg of Coumadin. The
following day , 5/27/99 , his INR was 1.1 and he got another 5 mg of
Coumadin. On 8/17/99 the patient's INR was 1.2 and he got another 5
mg of Coumadin. On 10/15/99 the patient got 7.5 mg of Coumadin and
his INR was 1.2 at that time. On 6/8/99 the patient got 10 mg of
Coumadin and his INR was 1.6 the following day on the day of
discharge , 1/3/99. On the day of discharge , 1/25/99 , the patient
will get 7.5 mg of Coumadin and his predicted daily dose will be
roughly 7.5 mg of Coumadin p.o. q.d.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg
p.o. q.d. ( this is a critical medicine and he should
be on this at all times despite being on Coumadin ) , Colace 100 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , iron 300 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Glyburide 5 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
NPH insulin 15 units subcu q.a.m. , CZI insulin sliding scale to get
4 units of regular insulin for blood sugar over 201 to 250 , 6 units
of regular insulin for blood sugar of 251 to 300 , 8 units of
regular insulin for blood sugar of 301 to 350 , and 10 units for
blood sugar 351 to 400 and , greater than 400 , house officer is to
be called. Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Demerol 50 to 100 mg p.o.
q4h p.r.n. pain , Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Glucophage 850 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , and Coumadin p.o. q.d. to be dosed according to daily
anticoagulation tests as stated previously with INR goal of 2 to
2.5.
