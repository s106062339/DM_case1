Discharge Date: 1/17/2005
ATTENDING: MARVIN , KERMIT M.D.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Status post cardiac arrest.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Orlikowski is a 54-year-old man with a history of diabetes ,
end-stage renal disease , CAD , long QT interval , seizure disorder ,
and mental status changes who presents following cardiac arrest.
The patient presented to his regular hemodialysis appointment at
Irun Adi Hospital on 2/20/05 where during his dialysis , he noted that he
began to feel strange. He had a questionable seizure earlier in
the day per history. During the dialysis , he became increasingly
confused and was sent for further evaluation to the Sidecoa Medical Center Emergency Room. At the Cleavexo Brock Hospital ED , an EKG was done ,
which showed tachycardia going in to torsade de pointes followed
by ventricular fibrillation. He underwent a DC cardioversion
shock at 200 joules and was converted to normal sinus rhythm.
The patient was then intubated , as he was being coded.
Furthermore , there is report of the patient developing a
tonic-clonic seizure during the bagging phase of intubation.
Follow this , a repeat EKG was obtained and showed a QT interval
of 540. His baseline is apparently around 510 milliseconds. His
electrolytes at that time were remarkable for potassium of 3.7 ,
bicarbonate of 30 , and magnesium level of 1.6 , and phosphate
level of 0.9. He did have a slightly elevated troponin level.
He was then transferred to the Centrah Steadmot Ain Medical Center for
further workup and management. On arrival , the patient was
intubated , sedated , with an amiodarone drip.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Diabetes mellitus , insulin dependent.
2. End-stage renal disease with hemodialysis , on Monday ,
Wednesday , and Friday.
3. CAD , status post a non-ST elevation MI in 6/29 .
4. A long QT syndrome.
5. Seizure disorder.
6. Alcoholic cardiomyopathy complicated by gastritis.
7. Chronic pancreatitis.
8. History of mental status changes with increased ICP.
9. Peripheral neuropathy.
10. Peripheral vascular disease.
11. Penile amputation secondary to infected implant.
12. Depression.
13. Hep B and hep C positive.
ALLERGIES:
Tetracycline.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
The patient was noted to be afebrile. His blood pressure was
notable to be 240/79 and heart rate of 72. He was intubated on
arrival on assist-control volume setting with the tidal volume of
500 mL , 12 beats per minute , on 50% oxygen. He was saturating
100% on room air. Pulmonary exam was notable for mechanical
breath sounds without any wheezes , rhonchi or rales.
Cardiovascular exam was notable for regular rate and rhythm , soft
2/6 holosystolic murmur heard loudest at the apex , and 2+ pulses
distally. His abdominal exam was unremarkable. Extremity exam
was notable for status post left leg below-the-knee amputation.
Neurologically , the patient was unresponsive secondary to
sedation , but was able to move all extremities when the sedation
was decreased. He did responded ??_____?? purposefully to pain.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1. Torsade de pointes status post DC cardioversion: Given his
history of torsade de pointes requiring cardioversion , upon
presentation to Neysing Areid Risbanks Hospital , Mr. Mazikowski
electrolytes were vigorously repleted. He underwent an ischemic
workup for the etiology for his initial presentation. He
continued to have a prolonged QT interval and therefore medicated
failed to exacerbate his already long QT interval , at baseline
were discontinued. He was discontinued from his Celexa and
levofloxacin. Throughout the remainder of his hospital course ,
Mr. Gift was closely monitored via telemetry and was noted to
have no further events of ventricular tachycardia.
2. Ischemia: When he presented , the ischemic etiology for his
ventricular tachycardia was considered. He was maintained on
aspirin and also continued on his Plavix. A cardiac
catheterization was done on 7/24/05 , which showed 30% occlusion
of the left anterior descending proximal coronary artery , 65%
occlusion of the ramus , 30% occlusion of the mid circumflex
artery , 50% occlusion of the marginal 1 artery , and 100%
occlusion of the distal RCA. None of these lesions were felt to
have caused his ischemia such that it would have been the
etiological factor for his torsades. He was followed throughout
his hospital course by the Electrophysiology Service.
3. Hypertension: While in the CCU , the patient had an echo ,
which showed severe concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with
an ejection fraction of 55%. He was started on vigorous
after-load reduction , which was titrated to his blood pressure
throughout his hospital course. At the time of discharge , he was
taking Lopressor , lisinopril , Norvasc , Isordil , and hydralazine.
4. End-stage renal disease: The patient was continued on his
repeat dialysis with close follow up from the Renal Service. He
underwent regular dialysis on Monday , Wednesday , and Friday while
at Apseph's Danale Hospital .  His electrolytes were followed
daily and repleted as needed.
5. Seizure disorder: The patient , although on presentation was
believed to have had a tonic-clonic seizure. He was maintained
on his Keppra throughout his course and was seizure-free while
hospitalized.
6. Diabetes mellitus: The patient presented with markedly
labile blood sugars. While admitted to the CCU , he was placed on
the Portland protocol in order to maintain tight glycemic
control. He was followed by the Endocrine Team , who recommended
switch to Lantus for basal control and regular insulin prior to
meals. His glucose levels were followed daily and his insulin
regimen was titrated in order to attain appropriate glycemic
control.
7. Nutrition: The patient was initially started on tube feeds
for nutrition. A NG tube was placed secondary to his altered
mental status. However , during his hospitalization , he had
multiple episodes of agitations , during which he pulled out his
NG tube. He was trialed with a soft diet after consultation with
the Speech and Swallow Service on 2/1 .  As he was able to
tolerate these p.o. feeds , this diet was continued.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
CONSULTANTS:
1. Electrophysiology Service.
2. Renal Service.
3. Endocrinology Service.
4. Speech and Swallow.
5. Physical therapy.
MEDICATIONS AT THAT TIME OF DISCHARGE:
Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. headache , aspirin 81 mg to be
taken daily , Colace 100 mg by mouth twice daily , folic acid 1 mg
by mouth daily , heparin 5000 units to be injected subcutaneously
three times daily while the patient is immobilized , hydralazine
40 mg by mouth every six hours , to be held for systolic blood
pressure less than 100 , insulin sliding scale , regular insulin 3
units to be taken prior to every meal , Isordil 30 mg by mouth
three times daily , to be held if systolic blood pressure is less
than 90 , Lopressor 25 mg by mouth three times daily , to be held
is systolic blood pressure is less than 100 or if the heart rate
is less than 55 , nystatin mouthwash 500 units by mouth to be used
four times daily , Keppra 500 mg by mouth once daily , Nexium 40 mg
by mouth twice daily , Lantus insulin 10 units subcutaneously once
daily , lisinopril 40 mg by mouth once daily , Norvasc 10 mg by
mouth once daily , to be held for systolic blood pressure less
than 100 , Lipitor 80 mg by mouth once daily , Nephrocaps one
tablet by mouth once daily , and Plavix 75 mg by mouth once daily.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:
The patient is in no acute distress. He is cachetic appearing
male. Pulmonary exam is notable for breath sounds that are
coarse bilaterally. Upper airways sounds are prominent. Cardiac
sounds are distant. He does have a systolic ejection murmur
loudest at the apex. His abdomen is benign. There was some mild
tenderness noted to be in the epigastrium. However , there is no
rebound or guarding. His extremity exam is notable for status
post left above-the-knee amputation. The patient is to follow up
with his primary care physician and is to follow up with
Endocrinology and to continue his dialysis on Monday , Wednesday ,
and Friday. He is to be discharged to a rehabilitation facility.
