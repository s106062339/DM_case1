DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 55-year-old man with a
history of smoking and a history of a
left sided hemisphere stroke who was normotensive , nondiabetic and
does not have known coronary disease who underwent a right-sided
femoral to popliteal bypass graft in February of 1986 for severe
claudication. This resulted in relief. He was readmitted in October
of 1988 for increase in pain in the calves which began at
ambulation of 30 feet. Angiographic evaluation at that time showed
a thrombosed graft and he was taken to the Operating Room for a
saphenous vein in situ right femoral to right popliteal bypass
graft. This was complicated by wound cellulitis which was
medicated in the appropriate manner and he was therefore
discharged. The patient was readmitted in February of 1988 with
graft stenosis and underwent angioplasty. After this procedure , he
had palpable pulses. He was readmitted in September of 1989 for
angioplasty. He presented at this time with progressive pain and
three months of frank rest pain in the right calf and claudication
of the left calf at 400 yards. He denied dependent rubor pallor or
coldness in the foot but he does have pain paresthesias. He has a
history of chest pain and was evaluated by an exercise tolerance
test in the past and was found not to have coronary artery disease
but was felt to have esophageal dismotility which was demonstrated
on the study. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Esophageal reflux. 2.
Left hemisphere stroke which resulted in residual right
hemiparesis. 3. Anxiety disorder. 4. Chronic low back pain. 5.
Peptic ulcer disease. 6. Herniated nucleus pulposus. PAST
SURGICAL HISTORY: 1. Femoral popliteal bypass graft in 1986. 2.

Cholecystectomy in 1986. 4. Lysis of adhesions for small bowel
obstruction in 1970 , repeated in 1970 again. 5. Resection of a
herniated nucleus pulposus in 1985. 6. Knee operation in 1974. 7.
Cystoscopy in 1986. MEDICATIONS: On admission included Pepcid ,

from esophageal dismotility.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission revealed a robust white male
in no acute distress. He had no skin
lesions. No lymphadenopathy. Head and neck exams were noteable
only for partial denture plates. The breasts had no masses or
discharge. Lungs were clear to auscultation. Heart had a regular
rate and rhythm without murmurs , rubs or gallops. The pulses were
palpable at the carotid and radials and dopplerable at the
popliteals , dorsalis pedis and posterior tibials bilaterally.
Abdomen was soft and nontender , nondistended. Bowel sounds were
present. There was no hepatosplenomegaly or masses. There was a
right paramedian scar. Genital examination revealed a normal
uncircumcised phallus with a redundant prepuce. Cord , scrotum ,
testes and external rings were unremarkable. Stool was guaiac
negative. Musculoskeletal examination was otherwise noteable for

revealed a numb right lower extremity with a negative pinprick
examination.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the Angiography Suite
on 2/7/90 where multiple segmental narrowings of
the right graft and complete occlusion of the left distal SFA with
distal reconstitution were discovered. He was taken to the
Operating Room by Dr. Dougherty on 7/16/90 where a right reverse
saphenous bypass graft from the in situ vein graft to below the
knee popliteal artery was performed by Dr. Bayani assisted by
Dr. Macgowan and Dr. Horwath . Postoperatively , the patient had
