ADDENDUM
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of diabetes ,
hypertension , CAD status post MI in 2000 who presented with an ST
elevation MI to the Emergency Room on 8/23/06 .  He was brought
to Cath where he was found to have in-stent thrombosis in his LAD. The clot was
aspirated and bare-metal stent was placed in his LAD
and another stent was placed in his diag-2. He suffered multiple V-Tach
cardiac arrests requiring CPR and cardioversion. In the
Cath Lab , he was given bicarb , placed on the epi drip , given
Lasix and was intubated. He was thought to aspirate at the time
of intubation secondary to vomiting. A bedside echo revealed
global hypokinesis with an EF of 35%. He , at that time , was
placed on a balloon pump , dopamine 16 , amio 1 , propofol 1 , and
Integrilin and brought to the CCU. On the floor , his blood
pressures were difficult to control and his PA catheter readings
indicated a wedge pressure of 47. His MAPs were marginal and max dopamine , max
Levophed , epinephrine and dobutamine were required to maintain a minimal blood
pressure.
His family was aware of his prognosis and was there at the time
of his arrest at 3:30 in the morning. CPR was initiated , and
ACLS was performed until the family decided to terminate the ACLS. At that
time , there were no spontaneous breath sounds , no heart sounds , and nonreactive
pupils. The cause of death was thought to be cardiogenic shock
secondary to ST elevation MI. His time of death was 3:47 a.m. on 8/23/06 .
