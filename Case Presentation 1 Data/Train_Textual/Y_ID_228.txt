PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for COPD , CHF , CAD , non-insulin-dependent diabetes

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is an 80-year-old gentleman with a long history of
COPD who is on 2 liters of nasal cannula at home with
80-pack-year of smoking history.
Briefly , the patient is an 80-year-old gentleman who was admitted
to Astine Emount Wallca Medical Center on 2/4/2004 with drowsiness and
slurred speech. Initial ABG showed pH of 7.25 , PCO2 of 82 , PO2
of 56 , sating 87%. He quickly awakened after Narcan was
administered. Recently , he had been taking an increased amount
of opiates for pain and he was admitted with a diagnosis of
hypercarbia secondary to increased opiate intake and COPD flare.
The patient had a long history of COPD. He has an 80-pack-year
of smoking history and is normally on 2 liters of nasal cannula
at home. He was initially treated for COPD on the floor and
given gentle hydration as he also suffers chronic renal
insufficiency. He was given Percocet for pain control. The
patient appears to be improving by serial arterial blood gasses.
Had decrease in creatinine and improved mental status. At 11:00
a.m. on the 6/29/2004 the patient was found breathless and
pulseless. At that time , his ABG showed a pH of 7.04 , PCO2 of
95 , PO2 of 47 , he was sating 54%. An ACLS code was 1. The
patient received 1 mg atropine and 0.04 of Narcan. He appeared
to be aspirating when intubated. He was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit where he was until 2/17/2004 , when he was
discharged.
ALLERGIES: The patient has questionable penicillin allergies
with unknown reaction.
PERTINENT PHYSICAL EXAM:
In general , the patient is an obese Hispanic male who is sedated
and intubated. He responds to commands and is oriented to voice
on admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit. His skin showed
his lower extremities with changes of chronic venostasis. He had
erythema to the knees , nonpitting edema bilateral to the knees
and induration of skin on legs , medial thigh , and bilateral
popliteal fossae. His feet had onychomycosis bilaterally with no
clearcut abrasions or cuts. The rest of his skin exam was
remarkable for multiple ecchymoses , one weeping plaque on the
abdomen at heparin injection site. His right subclavian line was
nontender and nonerythematous with one leaking port. Head and
neck exam: His pupils were equal , round and reactive to light and
accommodations. His extraocular movements were intact. His
oropharynx was clear. His endotracheal tube and OG tube were in
place. His chest sounds were clear anteriorly. He had decreased
breath sounds laterally. He had isolated wheezing at the left
midclavicular line. His heart sounds , S1 and S2 were heard. His
abdomen was obese. He had a large panus , no appreciable
organomegaly , tenderness and hyperactive bowel sounds.
Extremities: He was moving all four extremities spontaneously.
They were warm and perfused. Neurologically , his cranial nerves
were grossly intact. There were no focal anomalies.
On addition , the patient had a sodium of 140 , a potassium of 5.4 ,
chloride of 104 , carbon dioxide of 24 , BUN of 72 , creatinine of
2.1 , glucose of 153. She had an ionized calcium of 1.04 and
magnesium of 2.1.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Pulmonary. The patient was admitted to the MICU with
hypercarbic respiratory arrest and aspiration pneumonia per
symptoms , signs and chest x-ray. Given the history and timing of
the arrest , the patient likely was hypercarbic secondary to COPD
exacerbation , as hypercarbic arrest occurred several days in
house where opiates were not administered. It is highly
improbable that the arrest happened secondary to opiate ingestion
rather patient likely had COPD exacerbation. Also , the patient
has significant cardiac history of CHF and CAD , which may have
contributed. Subsequent chest CT on the floor demonstrated that
in addition the patient had very significant pleural effusions.
The patient was treated for aspiration pneumonia with
levofloxacin and Flagyl and aztreonam. He was also treated with
albuterol Atrovent nebulizers. Aggressive physical therapy was
also provided for the patient. The patient after completing his
antibiotic treatments for aspiration pneumonia was noted to have
MRSA growing in his sputum. He was given a 14-day course of
vancomycin as well to treat MRSA pneumonia. To help the
patient's pulmonary status , significant diuresis was attempted.
The patient was typically diuresed at 1-2 liters per day. The
aggressive diuresis was estimated to have taken in the
neighborhood of 15-20 liters of the patient and this likely
remarkably helped the patient's breathing status and his ability
to get off the ventilator. The patient had a tracheostomy and
peg placed on 8/27/04 and began breathing on trache collar on
the 6/11/04 and has been breathing until the present time
successfully on trache collar.
2. ID. The patient was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia. He
was also colonized with MRSA and VSE by the end of his course.
During his initial MICU admission he was diagnosed with
vancomycin sensitive enterococcal UTI. He was treated with
antibiotics for all of these. His aspiration pneumonia was
treated with levofloxacin , aztreonam and Flagyl. Subsequent MRSA
pneumonia was treated with vancomycin. The patient has not had ,
at the time of admission , white count or a significant fever and
his cultures two days prior to discharge have been negative.
3. Cardiovascular. The patient has a significant cardiac
history for CHF and CAD. His heart rhythm has been mostly stable
during the course of his hospitalization. Hypertension has been
treated with Lopressor.
4. Renal. The patient has a history of chronic renal
insufficiency. However , renal function had improved during the
patient's hospital course. At the time of discharge , the patient
had a creatinine of 0.9 , a BUN of 38 , a potassium of 3.9 and a
creatinine of 0.9. Presumably , the aggressive diuresis that was
conducted did not affect the patient's renal function adversely.
5. Endocrine. The patient has a history of
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. He was put on Lantus
and insulin sliding scale , by the end of his day he was on 80
units of Lantus plus requiring additional insulin on the sliding
scale.
CODE STATUS:
The patient is full code. The proxy for the patient is his
daughter , Picot , who was actively involved in the patient's care.
NUTRITION:
The patient was fed on Jevity tube feeds during most of his
medical ICU course.
DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM:
The patient's physical exam was notable for a tracheostomy in
place with a clean site of insertion. GJ tube placed in the
abdomen with a clean surgical wound. Clear sounding lungs with
breath sounds that can be heard more extensively than before from
the anterior side , resolving chronic venostasis and with those
exceptions the patient's exam remain similar to his admission
exam. In general , the patient is interactive , alert and
oriented.
