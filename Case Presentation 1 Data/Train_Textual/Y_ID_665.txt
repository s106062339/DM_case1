INTERIM DISCHARGE SUMMARY
SERVICE: Wamo Hospital Service.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Volume overload.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Beitz is a 74-year-old female
with congestive heart failure , aortic stenosis , obesity ,
hypoventilation syndrome on BiPAP at night , diabetes who presents
from rehabilitation with a 12 kg weight gain since the end of
October 2006. Her last admission to Y Health Center was complicated by a pCO2 of 80 requiring an ICU stay
and noninvasive ventilation. Moreover , the patient had a
gastrointestinal bleed and hematocrit to a level of 24. GI
consultant felt that due to the patient's comorbidities and
difficulty intubating the patient , she would not be a candidate
for either colonoscopy or EGD.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Chronic renal insufficiency ( baseline creatinine 1.2-1.7 ).
2. Crohn's in remission.
3. Gastrointestinal bleed on Coumadin.
4. Congestive heart failure.
5. Aortic stenosis.
6. Restrictive lung disease likely secondary to obesity.
7. Diabetes.
8. Arthritis.
9. Spinal stenosis.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Right mastectomy.
2. Two knee replacements.
3. Two laminectomies.
4. Gallbladder removal.
5. Exploratory laparotomy for chronic abdominal pain without
findings.
6. D&C.
ALLERGIES:
1. Heparin ( heparin-induced thrombocytopenia ).
2. Aspirin.
3. Demerol.
4. Codeine.
5. Dilaudid.
6. Ciprofloxacin.
7. Macrodantin.
8. Penicillin.
PREVIOUS STUDIES:
1. Echocardiogram 7/7/2005: Ejection fraction 65-70% , mild
concentric left ventricular hypertrophy , aortic valve was
thickened , stenotic , peak gradient 58 ( mean 33 ) , AVA 0.74 , mild
mitral regurgitation , mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation
( regurgitant velocity 3.2 m/s , pulmonary artery systolic pressure
40+ right atrial pressure ) , trace-to-mild pulmonic regurgitation.
2. Pulmonary function test 2/8/2006: FVC 31% , FEV1 23
percent , FEV1/FVC 77%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
On admission , 5/25/2006 , the patient's weight on admission was
130 kg. Her vital signs are as follows , temperature 95.8 , pulse
67 in atrial fibrillation , blood pressure 126/Doppler , the
patient had respiratory rate of 20 and an O2 saturation 95% on 4
liters. In general , the patient was in no acute distress ,
speaking in full sentences. Examination of the neck revealed JVP
to the ear , weak/weight carotid upstrokes , no bruits.
Cardiovascular examination revealed an irregular rhythm with an
S1 and weak S2. A 4/6 crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur was
heard best at the right upper sternal border radiating to the
carotids. Lung examination revealed crackles that heard at the
way up bilaterally with decreased breath sounds throughout. The
patient's abdomen was obese , but soft and nontender. Examination
of her extremities revealed a parvus at tardus. Lower extremity
pulses could not be palpated due to edema. The patient had 4+
lower extremity edema. Examination of the left shin showed
erythema , pain , swelling with a 2 x 2 cm ulcer on the left
anterior shin. The ulcer appeared clean , dry and intact with no
drainage.
STUDIES AT OUAH:
1. EKG on 5/25/2006 showed atrial fibrillation at 63 beats per
minute with a normal axis and poor R-wave progression.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. The patient presented in gross volume overload: We attempted
to diurese the patient with intravenous torsemide. Gradually ,
the dose of torsemide was increased from 100 twice a day to 200
twice a day. At the time of this dictation; however , the
patient's weight had decreased only to 124.6 kg. Her admission
weight on 7/15/2006 was 130 kg. However , this weight was
recorded in the bed ( not standing ). Her first standing weight
was recorded on 8/19/2006 at 125 kg. Her lower extremity edema
only mildly improved , however , at the time of this dictation , the
patient was able to put her shoes on , which she was unable to do
prior to admission. During this diuresis , the patient's
potassium was repleted twice a day. She was also maintained on
Aldactone and acetazolamide ( for elevated CO2 levels ). The
patient's lipid profile was measured during this hospitalization
and she had an LDL of 64. She was maintained on Zocor. Aspirin
cannot be administered due to the patient's drug allergy profile.
From a rhythm standpoint , the patient remained in atrial
fibrillation during this hospitalization through 5/18/2006. She
was not anticoagulation , given her history of HIT and history of
gastrointestinal bleed on Coumadin.
2. Pulmonary: The patient was maintained on BiPAP and Flonase
throughout her hospitalization. Her mental status was monitored
closely given her previous MICU stay during her last admission
for an elevated pCO2. However , the patient was alert and
oriented x3 during her hospitalization.
3. Renal: The patient's creatinine was stable at approximately
1.1 during her diuresis through 10/30/2006.
4. Gastrointestinal: The patient was maintained on Nexium
during her hospitalization. Her hematocrit remained stable at
approximately 32.4.
5. Endocrinology: The patient was maintained on Levoxyl and her
home NPH regimen.
6. Infectious disease: The patient was given vancomycin for
cellulitis on her left shin , which appeared to be improving as
the erythematous area was decreasing from 5/4/206 to
10/30/2006. She was also started on gentamicin on 10/11/2006 for
asymptomatic bacteriuria. The patient's urine culture on
8/19/2006 greater than 100 , 000 colonies of pseudomonas.
CODE STATUS: During this hospitalization , the patient reiterated
that she is a full code. It was discussed with her that she is
difficult and in fact possibly and possible intubation. She was
one time intubated nasally. In any event , she wants all life
saving measures performed. At the time of this dictation , she is
a full code ( healthcare proxy Harry Behran , phone number ( 860 ) 377-5068 ).
