Discharge Date: 8/12/2005
ATTENDING: GOETZE , BURTON M.D.
DATE OF BIRTH: 3/23/1927 .
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Hypovolemia and fatigue.
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES: Coronary artery disease , hypertension ,
hyperlipidemia , peptic ulcer disease , severe anxiety ,
cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction between 15% and 20% , and 2+
mitral regurgitation.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Weakness.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 78-year-old male with a
history of coronary artery disease status post silent MI and
cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction between 15% and 20% , who
has a longstanding history of severe anxiety and presented with
fatigue and shortness of breath. On the day of admission , the

325 daily , Lipitor 5 mg daily , Toprol XL 25 daily , Valium 5 mg
t.i.d. p.r.n. , Accupril 5 mg daily and Aleve p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: Sulfa causes rash and ciprofloxacin causes
hallucinations.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is an Irish descendent. He lives
alone with many cats. Drinks occasional ethanol , no tobacco or
illicit drugs. He is retired.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION: Temperature 95.6 , heart rate 112 ,

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Cardiovascular: Upon admission , the patient appeared dry and
was resuscitated with one liter of IV fluids. The patient's
Lasix was held initially on admission. On hospital day #2 , he
was looking well. His weight was 151 pounds which was suspected
to be close to his dry weight which was reportedly 149 pounds.
By 8/18/05 , he was restarted on 20 mg of Lasix daily so that he would stay
euvolemic. He received intermittent IV Lasix ( 20mg ) throughout the remainder
of his hospitalization and his p.o. Lasix dose was settled on 40 mg p.o.
daily. His captopril was restarted on the 9/19/05 at 6.25 mg t.i.d. He
tolerated that dose and was switched to Accupril 2.5 mg b.i.d. He underwent an
echocardiogram on 11/9/05 which demonstrated possible vegetation
on the tricuspid valve verus a flail leaflet. This question of a
vegetation raised concern for possible endocarditis and blood
culture were sent. The patient's temperature had been low on
admission , since there was some concern that he could be
developing sepsis , however nothing grew from the blood cultures
throughout the remainder of his hospitalization. He was seen by
Cardiology , who did not think that this echo result required
further intervention and suspected that it represented a flail
tricuspid valve leaflet. The patient's troponin
One troponin level was elevated at 0.11 initially and then
another troponin was elevated on 10/27/05 in the setting ARF and
acute hepatitis. He recently had a negative stress echo at the
Laketon Medical Center , so no additional stress testing
was pursued during this admission. He was switched to Lopressor
25 t.i.d. and then switched back to Toprol XL. His statin was
discontinued during the admission because of LFT abnormalities
which will be discussed below. He was monitored on telemetry
which demonstrated frequent PVCs and some NSVT. This
should be readdressed in Cardiology Clinic. Cardiology decided to hold off on
placing an AICD and was to see him as an outpt.
2. GI/renal: On the morning of 10/27/05 , the patient developed new confusion
and delirium. He also developed an oxygen
requirement the night before. His labs on morning were notable
for a transaminitis in the thousands , acute renal failure with
hyperkalemia and acidemia with bicarbonate of 13 , and a new leukocytosis ( WBC 9
to 25 ). He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics including coverage for
bartonella as he had many cats. He was empirically started on mucomyst and
acyclovir as per GI in case his LFT abnormalities were due to tylenol
toxicity or HSV. He was initially going to get a liver biopsy but this was
cancelled as his LFTs started to normalize. He had a RUQ with dopplers which
was negative. The etiology of his hepatitis , renal failure and leukocytosis was
never identified throughout the admission. Cardiology did not think that any
of this could be explained by endocarditis and his antibiotics were stopped
once his cultures were negative for multiple days. GI though he could of had
shock liver but he was on telemetry the entire time. His tylenol level was
normal and his hep seriologies were negative. His labs had all normalized by
admission except for his LFTs which were still trending downward.
3. Infectious disease: Due to low temperature and question of
vegetation , there was consideration for endocarditis and sepsis
although that never panned out. He has a history of feeding
stray cats and so bartonella cultures were sent. They take a
long time to come back and should be followed up as outpatient. He had been
placed on antibiotics while awaiting cultures but those were discontinued on
the 8/18/05 as the microbiology data remains negative. He had a CT scan of his
chest and abdomen which did not reveal any infectious source. He had ground
glass opacities on his CT chest which were felt to be due to CHF when reviewed
with the radiologist. He remained afebrile during the admission.
4. Psych: Early on during the patient's admission , he did have
several episodes of tachypnea at rest. They were not positional in nature
and resolved with verbal consolation and redirection and
deep breath. No associated desaturation at that time. The
patient has a history of anxiety and reported that that prompted
him to increase his Lasix dose at home. He refused psychiatric
consultation or social work involvement. His Valium had
initially been initiated but it was held in the setting of
abnormal LFTs. He had no further anxiety attacks after that. It
is likely that he has mild baseline dementia. His delirium
resolved after the acute renal failure and transaminitis resolved.
5. Musculoskeletal: The patient had a little bit of difficulty
ambulating and was seen by Physical Therapy who did think that
further physical therapy would be appropriate. The patient
refused to go to rehabilitation facility , so he was planning to
go home with services including physical therapy at home.
6. Hematology: The patient was set to go home and then it was
noted that his platelets had taken a slow and steady decline
throughout his hospitalization while he was on heparin/Lovenox. There
was concern that this could represent heparin induced
thrombocytopenia and so all heparin products were stopped. He was placed
lepirudin which was chosen instead of Argatroban because
Argatroban was cleared by liver in light of his hepatitis.
His initial PF4 was read as bordeline positive , but the laber later
changed the result to negative. Based on this discrepancy another PF4 was
sent which was borderline positive. As per the hematology consult , they felt
that despite the borderline positive PF4 he did not need prophylactic
anticoagulation and that he should refrain from heparin products in the
future until a repeat PF4 in checked in a few months.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg daily , Lasix 40 mg daily ,
Toprol XL 25 mg daily , Accupril 5 mg daily , omeprazole 20 mg
daily.
DIET: Low sodium.
ACTIVITY: As tolerated with supervision and advised by the
physical therapist.
FOLLOWUP APPOINTMENTS: Dr. Dougall is the patient's new PCP at
the GHAM MILL RIDOWN MEDICAL CENTER clinic at the Atl Hospital , he has an
appointment for 3/23/05 at 9:45 a.m. and an appointment with Dr.
Alquisira was made from Cardiology 10/21/05 at 2:45 p.m.
ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Do not take Valium or Lipitor until you
are cleared by your doctor to do so due to liver function. Weigh
yourself daily and keep a record and bring that to follow up
appointment. If you develop light headedness , shortness of
breath , chest pain or any other symptoms you are concerned about ,
call your doctor or return to the Pi Hospital emergency room for evaluation.

less than assay. He also had an elevated white blood cell count
during the transaminitis and renal failure up to 28. Final blood
culture , no growth from anaerobic medium. Urine culture , no
growth. HCV viral load of less than 615.
RADIOLOGIC DATA: Ultrasound of the abdomen showed no evidence of
portal vein thrombosis. Portable chest x-ray on 10/27/05 showed
the lung volumes considerably decreased from the previous exam on
9/29/05 .  There is hazy opacity in the lower lung sounds
particularly on the right suggesting mild edema. There also
appears to be small right effusion , mild cardiomegaly is again
noted. On 10/27/05 , CAT scan of the abdomen showed no apparent
source of infection , no collection or abscess , limited study
secondary to lack of IV contrast , mild ascites , bilateral pleural
effusions right greater than left with subsegmental atelectasis ,
presacral edema and cardiomegaly with left coronary artery
calcification. CAT scan of the chest on 10/27/05 showed
bilateral small pleural effusion , evidence of pulmonary edema and
small volume ascites associated with cardiomegaly , nodular ground
glass opacities at the right base may be due to atelectasis but
somewhat discrete , cannot exclude septic emboli but would be very
localized. A head CT on 9/29/05 showed no acute intracranial
abnormality.
