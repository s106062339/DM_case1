ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: Aortic insufficiency , mitral insufficiency , tricuspid
insufficiency and atrial fibrillation.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This 78-year-old male with long
history of moderate mitral regurgitation as well as aortic
regurgitation. He was noted on EKG in 2003 to be in atrial fibrillation
was asymptomatic at that time. The patient also in October of
2005 had an acute MI and at that time underwent angioplasty and
stent placement with a drug-eluting stents of the LAD and the
diagonal arteries. He on admission was not on any Plavix for the
stents. He has been in congestive heart failure with
multivalvular dysfunction now noted to have severe pulmonary
hypertension with estimated PA pressures in 99 mmHg plus RA
pressures and referred for surgical repair of his valves.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient's past medical history is
significant for the aortic , mitral , and tricuspid regurgitation as
stated above with high PA pressures as well as atrial
fibrillation also as stated above , status post angioplasty with
drug-eluting stents of his LAD and diagonal arteries. The
patient also has a history of hypercholesterolemia , recent
immunosuppressive therapy with prednisone 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. for
ITP. The patient also is in atrial fibrillation with Coumadin
therapy. The patient has history of squamous cell carcinoma of
his left tonsils requiring XRT. His creatinine clearance is
estimated as 55 mL per minute.

LABORATORY DATA:
On 10/10/05 , chemistries: Sodium of 135 , K of 4.5 , chloride of
100 , CO2 of 30 , BUN of 44 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose of 124 , and
magnesium of 2.4. Hematology from 11/18/05 , white count of 9.4 ,
hematocrit of 39 , hemoglobin of 13 , platelets of 120 , the PT ,
INR , and PTT from the day before of the 28 of November , the preop values PT
of 16 , INR 1.3 , and PTT of 22.9. Echo on 6/6/05 , left
ventricle was moderately dilated. Overall LV function was low normal ,
the estimated EF of 50-55. The ventricle was
mildly hypokinetic with regional variation and right ventricle
size is mildly enlarged , global right ventricular systolic
function is moderately reduced. The left atrium is moderately
dilated and right atrium is moderately dilated. The aortic valve
is trileaflet calcified and mild-to-moderate aortic regurgitation
as noted. Mitral valve is thickened and mildly retracted with
malcoaptation , moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation in some
views. The valve does not appear to coapt. Tricuspid valve is
structurally normal , but severe tricuspid regurgitation is noted
with PA pressures of 99 mmHg plus right heart pressures.
Pulmonic valve is indicated as normal with mild pulmonic
regurgitation. Aortic root size is normal measuring 3.6 cm , PA
arteries normal size , inferior vena cava is noted to be dilated ,
but not pulsatile. EKG on 5/25/05 , atrial fibrillation at the
rate of 70. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 10/10/05 and
underwent a cardiac catheterization which showed 25% proximal
LAD , 30% mid RCA , right dominant circulation. The ventriculogram
showed an ejection fraction of 64%. Hemodynamics PA mean of 22 ,
pulmonary capillary wedge of 7 , cardiac output of 4.0 , cardiac
index of 2.1 and an SVR of 1239 and PVR of 319 with moderate
aortic insufficiency and moderate mitral insufficiency. The
patient was taken to the operating room on 11/18/05 , and
underwent an aortic valve replacement with a 23
Carpentier-Edwards magna valve and a mitral valve repair with a
23 CarboMedics AnnuloFlex ring and a tricuspid valve repair. The
patient also had bilateral maze procedure with also resection of
the left atrial appendage , as well as his right atrial appendage.
The patient had two A-wires and ventricular wire placed and was
initially paced after the maze procedure. The patient came off
the heart lung machine on epinephrine , levo , and
milrinone and was taken up to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit and
extubated on late postop day #1. The patient's hospital course
by systems ,
Neurological: The patient remained intact with no focal
deficits , however , the patient experienced dysphasia due to his
tonsil cancer status post XRT , failing speech and swallow and
finally requiring a PEG placement for nutritional support.
Cardiovascular: The patient was status post a maze procedure and
initially was paced and found to be in a junctional rhythm at 60
then recovery of normal sinus rhythm , however , postoperatively
had gone into a rate controlled atrial fibrillation requiring
low-dose beta-blocker as well as anticoagulation. However , he
did see few episodes of sinus rhythm and currently on discharges
in sinus rhythm and rate controlled on low-dose beta-blocker.
The patient did have an echo postoperatively to evaluate his
valve replacement and repair and found to have normal LV size and
function with an EF of 55%. The patient had mild RV enlargement ,
mild left atrial enlargement as well as right atrial enlargement.
The aortic valve was noted to be well seated with trace AI ,
mitral valve status post repair showed mild mitral regurgitation ,
tricuspid valve status post repair showed mild tricuspid repair
with PA pressures of 40 mmHg. There was no pericardial effusion
found and patient will be discharged on low-dose beta-blocker as
well as anticoagulation.
Respiratory: Patient was extubated on late postoperative day #1
and patient was on Lasix for diuresis postoperatively. The
patient , however , on postoperative day #10 , was noted to have a
temperature and culture showed that he had enterobacter in his
sputum and is being treated with ceftriaxone for a 14-day course.
His discharge chest x-ray shows no evidence consolidation and
mild atelectasis at the left base , no pulmonary edema noted.
GI: The patient had a history of GERD and was on Zantac
preoperatively and was on proton pump postoperatively and
switched over to Pepcid for GI prophylaxis. The patient also was
closely followed by the speech and swallow team and due to his
dysphagia status post squamous cell carcinoma resection of his
left tongue and XRT , patient continues to have dysphasia , unable
to protect his airway and by postoperative day #14 underwent a
PEG placement and now at goal of 70 mL per hour to see if he is
tolerating without any problems. The patient however was on
diuresis for a period of time and required few doses of fluid
bolus for his volume status.
Renal: The patient had a stable BUN and creatinine throughout
his postoperative course , was on Lasix for diuresis postop
without no elevation in his creatinine.
Endocrine: The patient was on portland protocol intraoperatively
and switched over to sliding scale insulin postoperatively due to his
tube feeds. He is on regular insulin standing now at 6 units
with sliding scale for coverage.
Heme: The patient was noted to have a drop in his platelets
postoperatively. Two hit screens were sent which were found to
be negative and patient had recovery of his platelets with
discharge platelets of 196. The patient will be discharged on
Coumadin for atrial fibrillation. Today's INR is 2.1 and he will
be getting his preop dose of 2.5 mg tonight and to follow closely
with his INR. He is also on baby aspirin for his coronary artery
disease and patient was not on Plavix for his stent
preoperatively and will not be on discharge.
ID: The patient received vancomycin for surgical prophylaxis.
On postoperative day #10 , the patient was noted to have a
temperature of 101 and was cultured. Sputum grew out
enterobacter and patient was started on ceftriaxone and will
complete a 14-day course of ceftriaxone. The patient during that
time received neb treatments , chest physical therapy and is still
continuing to bring up some secretion. The patient was noted
also to have a heel blister on his left heel which was debrided
and now is very clean and dry ulcer that was evaluated by the
skin nurse and felt that Xeroform would be the best treatment at
this time and the legs should be elevated on pillows to relieve
any pressure off of the heel for continual healing and
prevention or breakdown. The patient is in stable condition and
has been accepted to a rehab bed on postoperative day #20 and
will be discharged to the rehab facility in stable condition on
these following medications.
