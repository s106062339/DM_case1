orthopnea , PND , and LE swelling , BNP=870. Was admitted for treatment of

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CV:
*Pump: Cont'd ACE ( Lisinopril 40daily ) , utilized Lasix ( max Lasix dose
40IV bid ) to initiate diuresis. Orthopnea resolved after 3days of
diuresis. ECHO obtained on HD#4=nl LV size w/mild conc hypertrophy , and
severely reduced function ( EF15-20% ) and global hypokinesis. Mod RVE
and hypertrophy , and globally reduced function. Mild LAE , mod RAE.
Trace to mild MR , mod to severe TR , trace PR , and sm pericardial
effusion. The CHF service consult ( Dr. Busler ) obtained hx of 20oz
port wine consumption 3+days/wk. CHF team is attributing non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy to idiopathic vs ETOH. Rec'd goal SBP<120 ,
agreed w/diuresis , ACE , +/-adding ARB , and changing b-blocker back to
Atenolol.
CHF team advised there is was clear indication for anti-coagulation. F/u
appts made Houston Jackson Hugo K. Torain . Pt will have VNA-CHF
home services.
Admit wt=197.6lbs , d/c wt=185.5lbs.
*Isch: Hx of NSTEMI , pos MIBI , neg cardiac cath 11/3 .  Has a baseline
abnormal EKG that is concerning for inf/lat ischemia. Had a troponin
leak this admit in setting of CHF. Repeat CAD workup not pursued. Cont'd
Aspirin , and B-blocker ( was initially on Metoprolol 25tid , then
transitioned back to Atenolol 50daily per CHF service recs ).
Tchol=119 , HDL=26 , LDL=77. Pt is DM , but no statin was started b/c of
elevated LFTs.
*Rhythm: Episode of NSVT 10/23 ( R-on-T VT in setting of QT prolongation
QTc=526 ). No additional ventricular arrhythmias were recorded on
via continuous telemetry monitoring. CHF service advised deferring AICD
placement unless pt fails 6mos of optimal medical CHF managment. Repeat
EKG's 10/13 QTc=495 , 5/9 QTc=478. Decision was made to cont Fluoxetine ,
given the minute risk that this med would contribute to QT prolongation.
2. GI:
*Team suspects hepatocongestion/GI venous congestion and/or gut ischemia
from poor arterial perfusion as cause of recent GI c/o's and LFTs. Low
grade abd pain and N/V resolved as team treated CHF , transaminases
remained ess unchanged.
PRN Reglan was continued. If GI symptoms return , pt may need additional
outpt workup ( HIDA scan , gastric emptying study ). Pt has an existing GI
appt to see Dr. Skwara in 11/13 .
*Cont'd PPI for gastritis , duodenitis seen on EGD 10/25 .  It is unclear if
this can completely explain pt's Fe def anemia. She will need an outpt
colonoscopy to further eval.
*Celiac sprue studies were sent=pending at time of discharge.
3. ENDO: hx of DM-2 , HgA1c=8.8. Pt advised team that she prefer to
discontinue Glucophage in favor of starting insulin. During this admit DM
was managed w/bid NPH , pre-meal novolog , and AC/HS novolog scales. On
10/13 pt's total insulin requirement was 44units. FSBS 6/12 8am ) ,
271( 12pm ). Pt to transition to Lantus 35units qam to begin 7/25 .  VNA
arranged for insulin teaching and to assist PCP w/dose titration. Syringe
education was provided.
4. HEME:
*RBC: microcytic hypochromic fe deficient anemia. RI=2.19. Pt did not
save stool to perform stool guaiac testing. Cont'd Ferrous Sulfate this
admit , added Colace and Senna for constipation prophy. Will likely need
outpt colonoscopy , team deferring this to PCP and Dr. Daso ( outpt GI ).
Hg-electrophoresis was sent=pending at time of discharge.
*Coags: mildly elevated PTT/INR this admit. Suspect nutritional
depletion of vit K +/- ?liver dysfunction from CHF/liver congestion
leading to mild auto-anticoagulation. INR improved as pt able to
tolerate POs. She was not treated w/Vit K.
5. MISC:
*Nutrition consulted for heart failure and DM diet teaching.
TH social worker was consulted to assist pt w/maintaining abstinence
upon discharge. Pt given instructions to f/u w/her outpt Jerrod J Whitehill at Insonmahunt , New York 40955
*Full code during this admission.
