1. PULM: admitted with mild worsening of chronic hypoxia related to
restrictive lung disease , obesity hypoventilation and obstructive sleep
apnea. Her baseline home oxygen requirement in 5-6L by nasal cannula
along with nasal BiPAP at night 16/8. She had decompensated to 7-8Lnc
and was complaining of dyspnea , both of which resolved with iv lasix
and 2-3liters negative diuresis. She is chronically deconditioned and
obese and refused to go to a rehabilitation facility , even pulmonary
rehab.
2. CV: followed by Dr. Seling of cardiology; diuresed with iv lasix and
diamox with bicard between 30-35 during admission. No active ichemic i
ssue or arrhythmias noted during admission. Discharged on home
diuretic regimen of 80mg lasix po qd with instructed to take an extra
pill once if she feels like her ankles are swelling or she is
particularly short of breath and no phone her physician.
3. ID: CXR negative for infiltrate , no fever no cough and no evidence
of pneumonia. Ms. Boerner had her influenza vaccination this year
already.
4. Social: SW consulted , patient lives alone , has no support network
and is chronically noncompliant with medical and dietary
recommendations. Cardiac and pulmonary social work have both been
involved in her care in the past. PT consulted and recommended
pulmonary rehab , but patient refused. Her primary support is from an
internet friend who lives in Reve Ins and despite bargaining with staff
about which medicines to take and when to discharge her , she was well
enough to go on her scooter to visit "friends" in the hospital and get
high salt food from Connecticut She was discharged in stable condition with
oxygen back to her baseline levels of 96% on 5l nc and will follow up
with her pcp.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Continue to eat a low salt , low total fluid diet. Follow up with your
primary care physician , you cardiology and your hematologist as
necessary. There are no increased oxygen requirements at this time. If
you feel like your ankles are swelling or you are having trouble
breathing , please take one extra lasix pill and call your physician for
further instructions.
