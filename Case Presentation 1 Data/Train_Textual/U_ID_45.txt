BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
74 yo woman in remission from Hodgkin's Lymphoma
and s/p renal transplant( 1/20 ) who p/w hypoxia , low grade fever in
setting of colonoscopy under general anesthesia. Pt had PET scan on
4/3 which showed uptake in asc colon and hep
flexure concerning for malignancy. CT colonoscopy
showed 1.6 les in desc colon and colonoscopy under
GA performed due to difficulty of going beyond
hep flexure. Pt had hypoxia to 80s when
awakening from anesthesia. Temp to 101.1. CXR showed
?LLL opacity. Thought to be likely Pneumonitis vs. asp PNA. In Pacu
Pt also had EKG changes , TWIs and ? BBB assoc
with HR70s-80s. EKGs resolved when rate in 60s.
Physical Exam revealed AOOx3 woman in NAD. PERRL. No carotid bruits.
Cardiac exam remarkable for RRR , 2/6 murmur at RUSB. There are
crackles at LL base to mid lung field. Abd exam there is
rebound and invol guarding. Tenderness in epigastric
and suprapubic area. +BS. No hepatomegaly.
Labs significant for HCt 24 from baseline of 30 , Cr
1.9 from baseline of 1.6. Cardiac enzymes were flat.
HOSPITAL COURSE:****************
1. Pulm-On floor pt's oxygenation improved within one day to 96% on RA
Likely aspiration , but final read on
CXR shows no infiltrate/opacity. Levo/Flagyl given empirically x 5days
though she remained afeb.
2. CV-Pt has h/o MI , RCA stent , mod AS. Low Hct and EKG changes
concerning for
myocardial injury. Her cardiac enzymes were negative after the initial
hypoxic episode , and EKG changes resolved. Transfused 2u PRBCs. On
4/23 she had Afib with RVR to 130s with chest arm pain which is her
anginal equivalent. ECG with rate related ischemia ST depression
V5-6 , L. +Minimal troponin leak to 0.19 , which subseq downtrended
with nl CK. She was init treated with lopressor 5mg
IV but had hypotension to 80's which resolved quickly with IVF. She was
eventually rate controlled with dilt drip. She returned to sinus
rhythm within the day. Cards c/s'd
and recommended amio load. She had PFT's , LFT's and TFT's prior to
d/c. Plan to follow up with Dr. Lenberg . Consider anticoagulation for
PAF , this is at least 2nd episode. Pt to restart ecasa 5d p colonosco
py.
2. GI-Pt had abd exam concerning for focal peritoneal
irritation. It is likely that she had a microperforation during
colonoscopy as CT showed fluid in pelvis and she had Hct drop
requiring 2U pRBC. Her exam improved , and she was tolerating PO well
at the time of discharge. She has been afeb and well appearing for
several days prior to d/c. Plan to complete 5d abx. As per Dr. Thorburn
her colonoscopy was complex , and she had polypectomy of 2.5 cm polyp.
Path is pending. If + for cancer , the base looked "clean" , so may be
feasible to re-scope her for surveillance at a later time , as per GI.
3. HEME- Hct after colonoscopy went to
24 ( baseline 30 ); post-transfusion HCt of 30.
5. s/p Renal transplant. Continuing meds.
