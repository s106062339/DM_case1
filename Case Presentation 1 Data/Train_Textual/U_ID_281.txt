ADMISSION CXR: nl cadiac silhouette , clear lungs
HOSPITAL COURSE:
86 yo man w/ acute renal failure , gross hematuria , bladder mass.
RENAL:
*ARF* Original ddx included prerenal ( decreased PO intake , glucosuria )
vs. renal ( URI --> glomerulonephritis ) vs. postrenal ( mass , clots -->
B obstruction ... but no hydronephrosis ). Cr came down from 5.3 to near
nl w/ hydration suggesting prerenal etiology. Urine examined under
microscope was without red blood cell casts. On presentation , pt. had no
acute indication for dialysis. He was not uremic , had no rub , had good
urine output , had mild acedemia , and had normal K.As noted , his Cr came
down to near normal with hydration.
*bladder mass* A bladder mass surrounded by blood clots was identified on
the patient's admission CT. Due to conern for bladder cancer , urine
cytology was sent. Results are pending. On 8/19 , the urology team
performed a cystoscopy which revealed a large bladder stone surrounded by
hemorrhage. The clot was evacuated and the stone was broken up by
electrohydraulic lithotripsy. Biopsy samples were
taken from the inflamed bladder wall. Pathology results are pending. A
3-way foley catheter was placed and continuous bladder irrigation was
initiated. The patient received peri-procedure antibiosis with ancef and
gent. The large size of the bladder stone suggests urinary retension ,
perhaps due to persistent BPH ( despite 2000 TURP ). The patient was started
on flomax and proscar , as recommended by the urology team. The patient was
discharged with a foley catheter in place. He will return to NC urology
clinics on 10/22 for a voiding trial.
CV:
pump
*HTN* In house , pt. was treated with norvasc and lopressor. He was
discharged on norvasc and toprol XL. Ace inhibition was not initiated due
to the patient's renal insufficiency.
*murmur* On exam , pt. had a systolic ejection murmur heard best at the
R and L upper sternal border and radiating to the carotids. An ECHO
revealed a preserved ejection fraction of 65% , no RWMA , nl
diastolic function , normal RV size and function , nl LA and RA size ,
and mild AS with a valve area of 1.4. The patient is not
symptomatic from his AS , by history. He denies syncope , chest pain ,
orthopnea , PND , or LE edema.
rhythm: NSR
ischemia:
*CAD*
Pt. reported no chest pain. His admission EKG showed new inferior/lateral
ST-T changes. Cardiac markers revealed CK 330 , CKMB 7.5 , and Tn I<assay.
His EKG changes could represent old infarct ( although ECHO showed no
RWMA ) or could represent demand ischemia in the setting of
hypertension and anemia. Pt. was treated with a bblocker , as above. Pt was
not treated with ASA given his hematuria , but such
therapy may be started on an outpatient basis. Pt. was not treated with an
acei due to his creatinine , but such therapy , too , may be started on an
outpatient basis. Pt. may also benefit from outpt. stress testing. Lipids
profile showed cholesterol 156 , triglycerides 119 , HDL 39 , LDL 93.
GI: *reflux* Pt. was treated with nexium and mylanta PRN.
He was maintained on a cardiac , diabetic diet.
ENDO: *new DM , most likely type II* On admission pt. had a small anion
gap , mild elevation of +B-hydroxybutyrate , and +ketones in his urine.
With hydration , his gap closed. The ketoacidosis was likely from
starvation. Pt's HGa1c was 10. ( He had not seen a physician in years ). He
will be d/c'ed on glipizide 5. ( Metoformin was not started out of concern
for rising creatinine. He may benefit from the addition of a second oral
agent as an oupatient ). Pt. will be given a glucometer and asked to check
his blood sugar mornings.
HEME: *anemia* Pt. had a normocytic anemia , likely related to hematuria ,
gu+ stool. Iron studies revealed a Fe 49 , TIBC 294 , Ferr 73. He
was started on a multivitamin with iron. He would benefit from outpatient
colonoscopy. Prior to discharge , hematocrit was stable in the mid 30s.
ID: Pt. was afebrile. Admission u/a was suggestive of UTI. Ucx , however ,
was negative. CXR was clear. Pt. received abx peri-cystoscopy.
PROPH: pneumoboots ( pt. was not treated with lovenox given his
hematuria )
CODE: full
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Pt. will require VNA for nursing and home PT.
