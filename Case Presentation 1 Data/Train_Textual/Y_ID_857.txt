BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Kolppa was a 58-year-old
woman with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and ejection
fraction of 15% who was initially admitted to the Faharb Medical Center Of following a cardiac arrest. On arrival in the
emergency department she was found to have recurrent ventricular
tachycardia and was defibrillated. She required an intraaortic
balloon pump to maintain her blood pressure.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy. She has a pacemaker/ICD. She has a history of
chronic kidney disease , deep venous thrombosis , history of
cerebrovascular accident , history of hypercholesterolemia ,
history of coronary artery disease , history of diabetes , history
of GI bleed and history of chronic hepatitis C.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS: Ms. Rubins had a complicated
course in the hospital and her care was related primarily to
recurrent ventricular tachycardia and prolonged anoxic injury
affecting multiple organ systems. During her hospital course ,
she required pressor medications , an intraaortic balloon pump ,
and ventilator support. Of note , the patient had noted , prior to her
admission , that she would never want to be dependent upon "machines." Due to
poor neurological status and poor
prognosis , and in conjunction with the patient's previously expressed wishes ,
medical care was withdrawn on 4/25 after many discussions with family. The
patient's primary care physician , Dr Sangh , was involved with these
discussions. The intraaortic balloon pump was turned off. Pressure medications
were held and the mechanical ventilator was stopped. The patient passed away
on 11/17/07 shortly after removal of mechanical support.
