HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Barriger is a 73-year-old gentleman who is a restrained driver
in a single car motor vehicle collision , in which the car went
off the road at a moderate rate of speed ( approximately 45 miles
an hour ) , and struck a telephone pole. There are no skin marks
noted at the scene. There was airbag deployment , and the patient
was wearing a seatbelt. The patient reports feeling "fine" prior
to the motor vehicle collision. However , he has no recollection
of the motor vehicle collision itself , and the next thing he
remembers is waking up and finding the airbag is deployed , and
being in severe pain. He does remember EMS arriving.
Upon arrival of the EMS , he was found to have a heart rate of 30
in a third-degree AV block. The patient denies any chest pain ,
shortness of breath , nausea or vomiting before the motor vehicle
collision. He also denies any fevers , chills , night sweats ,
shortness of breath , headaches or visual changes either before or
after. He had no recent changes in any doses of his medications.
He was also complaining of knee pain.
ED COURSE: In the Emergency Department , he was seen by the
Trauma Team. A full dictation of the Emergency Department
courses has been completed. Please see the computer for further
details of this dictation. However , in brief , he had numerous
CAT scans performed while in the Emergency Department. These
included a CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis , head , and chest.
There was also a CT of the cervicothoracic and lumbar spine , with
reconstructions performed. As well as plain x-rays films of the
lower extremity as well a pelvis , C-spine , and chest. Of
significance , the plain films of the knee were negative. The CAT
scan of the chest demonstrated a right frontal periventricular
hypodensity , which was thought to represent a subacute infarct.
He was subsequently admitted to the Cardiac Step-Down Floor. He
was seen by the Neurology Service ( Dr. Orban , who is the
Neurology resident ) , who initially saw him.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Significant for myocardial infarction , eight years ago. He
received cardiac stents at that time.
2. Hypertension.
3. Hypercholesterolemia.
4. Diabetes.
5. Renal cyst.
6. Cataract.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Significant for coronary stenting; two were placed eight
years ago during his MI , and he had an additional two stents
placed in September of 2004.
2. Cataract removal.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Glyburide 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. Metformin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day.
4. Zocor 80 mg p.o. q. day.
5. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q. day.
6. Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q. day.

and nondistended. There are good bowel sounds in all four
quadrants. There is no CVA tenderness. The pelvis is stable to
rock. Extremities: There is tenderness in the abrasions over
the left knee. The left knee is in an immobilizer , at the time
of admission to the floor. He has full range of motion in
ankles , shoulders , and elbows bilaterally. There is decreased
range of motion in the left knee. There is no bony tenderness
along any of the long bones of the upper or lower extremities ,
with exception of the knee. Peripheral vascular , dorsalis pedis ,
posterior , tibial , and radial pulses are all equal bilaterally.
Neuro exam: He is awake , alert , and oriented x3. Cranial nerves
II-XII are intact. Motor is 5/5 in the upper and lower

well-perfused.
LABORATORY DATA UPON ADMISSION:
CT C-spine negative. CT head shows a right frontal subacute
infarct. CT chest shows anterior fifth rib fractures
bilaterally. There was also some supraclavicular stranding along
the left side , without any evidence of vessel injury. CT of the
abdomen and pelvis is negative , except for a ruptured renal cyst.
He was also incidentally noted to show diverticulosis , without
any diverticulitis. The CT of the thoracic and lumbar spines
also demonstrated no fractures , although there were incidentally
noted to be anterior osteophytes in numerous levels. CT of the
chest demonstrated the rib fractures , but was otherwise negative.
Laboratory , sodium 138 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 103 , bicarbonate
25 , BUN 28 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 185 , and anion gap is 10 , AST
and ALT are 20 and 25 respectively. Alkaline phosphatase is 80.
Lipase is 51. Calcium is 8.8 , the albumin is 4.6 , the CK is 89 ,
CKMB is 3.6 , and troponin was less than assay. His serum
toxicology screen was negative for aspirin , Tylenol ,
benzodiazepine , barbiturates , and tricyclics. Urine drug screen
is also negative. PT , PTT , and INR were 13 , 25.8 , and 0.9
respectively. CBC was significant for white count of 12.0 ,
hemoglobin and hematocrit were 14.6 and 42.2 , and platelets are
250. Urinalysis was negative.
Review of the prehospital EKG demonstrated a complete
( third-degree ) heart block. However , EKG done immediately upon
admission to the Trauma Bay demonstrated a bifascicular block ,
with a rate in the 40s.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular: He was admitted to the Cardiac Step-Down
Unit. He had Zoll pacer pads were placed upon his chest , and
atropine remained at his bedside. He also had an additional Zoll
pacer pads , as well as the pacemaker standby at the bedside ,
however , these were not needed , as he has completed asymptomatic
with his bifascicular block. He had serial enzymes , which were
performed , he was ruled out for myocardial infarction. He went
to the Cardiac Cath Lab , which demonstrated some coronary artery
disease. Please see the dictated cardiology reports for the
findings of the Cath Lab. It was felt , however , this was
unchanged from prior studies. He also went to the
Electrophysiology Lab. They were unable to induce any
ventricular tachycardia or other dysrhythmias during the
prolonged EP studies. He had a pacemaker inserted. The
pacemaker was followed by the Electrophysiology Service , and was
found to be working adequately. The attending was Dr. Matt Duropan ,
with the Electrophysiology Service. Dr. Caires with the
Cardiology Service saw him and was attending on record.
2. Neurology: He was seen by the Neurology Service. So , this
was under Dr. Edgardo Mccorison , the attending neurologist on the
case. He had an MRI/MRA performed of his head and neck. The
diffusion-weighted images demonstrated no evidence of any
abnormality. There was a region of increase signal intensity on
the T2 and FLAIR images , involving the vasoganglion , extending
the corona radiata. Therefore , given the fact that signal was
seen on the T2 and FLAIR , not on the diffusion-weighted , it was
felt that this was at least 10 days old. Therefore , this was not
felt to be either the cause nor an affect of the motor vehicle
collision. It was most likely represented an old CVA , which was
not previously detected. Given the fact that the patient
remained asymptomatic , and had a normal neurological exam , and
radiographic data demonstrated that this infarct was more than 10
days old , and this was not further addressed. An MRA of his head
and neck demonstrated tortuous vertebrobasilar system. The
MRI/MRA of the neck was essentially normal , however , the left
bifurcation was thought to be without any significant stenosis.
The right bifurcation is probably without significant stenosis ,
however , could not be completed excluded. Given artifact , this
could be further followed up with an outpatient venous duplex of
the carotid arteries.
3. Musculoskeletal: He was seen by the Orthopedic Service in
the Emergency Department at the time of the trauma , he ultimately
had an MRI that was performed of his knee. This showed tears of
the medial and lateral menisci. There was no evidence of
fracture. He remained in a knee immobilizer. He saw Physical
Therapy , which felt that further therapy would be indicated.
With the impression of the Orthopedic Service that no acute
intervention was needed , and that he should follow-up with Sports
Medicine or Orthopedics in approximately 3-4 weeks. In addition ,
he was noted to have several rib fractures. The rib fractures
were felt to be the source of his pain , he continue to complain
of some inspiratory pain throughout his chest. However , he
adamantly denied any pain throughout his chest wall upon
inspiring. It was therefore felt that given the negative enzymes
and the negative Cath , and the known rib fractures that the chest
pain was strictly a result of a musculoskeletal pain. This pain
was well controlled with the combination of Dilaudid and
oxycodone. He was encouraged to take several deep breaths per
hour to reduce the risk of atelectasis or pneumonia.
4. Infectious Disease: There was no evidence of any acute
infection. Of note , his white count was trending upwards , on the
last two days of admission. It was felt that this probably
represented stress , given all the recent procedures that were
done , including the catheterization and the electrophysiology
studies , rather than A2 infection. The chest x-ray was performed
on the 25th , which demonstrated no infiltrate. This was reviewed
with an attending radiologist who reported low lung volumes.
Otherwise , it was essentially negative. In addition , a repeat
urinalysis was performed. The results are pending at the time of
dictation , however , will be followed up prior to the patient's
discharge from the hospital. The patient appears well , and
states that he is feeling at his best since the accident.
However , further workup for his white count is not performed at
the present time , however , the patient is informed , as the No Hospital and the discharge summary , which show that the patient
seem to develop any evidence of infection that he should be
reevaluated by a physician.
5. Nutrition: The patient is able to eat without any
difficulty. He was eating regular house diabetic/cardiac diet.
6. Hypercholesterolemia: He was continued on his Zocor
throughout the hospitalization.
7. Prophylaxis: He was initially treated with Lovenox 40 mg
sub-Q. q. day for a prophylaxis against DVTs. He is also on
aspirin and Plavix for secondary cardiac and neurological
prophylaxis. The Lovenox is discontinued , at the request of the
Electrophysiology Service on the 24th.
8. Endocrine: Given the numerous contrast studies , initially
his metformin was held. However , he was later restarted on this.
In addition , he was continued on his glyburide and covered with
sliding scale insulin. His blood sugar was never any significant
problem during his hospitalization.
9. Disposition: The patient will be going to Missp Medical Center , in
stable condition. At the Rehab , he will continue to get physical
therapy , which he has received in the hospital. It was felt that
a short course of rehab would benefit the patient to allow him to
go back living independently again. He will be discharged to the
Rehab in stable condition.

week. Appointment with Dr. Mittman is in 3 weeks.
ADDENDUM:
Mr. Flentge had this pacemaker placed and was recovering
uneventfully. However , it was noted that he started having
increasing white count. It was felt this was perhaps due to a
mild urine infection and was started on Levaquin. However , he
started the next day complaining increasing pain in his knee. At
this time , his white count had risen to 23 , 000. The knee was
obviously a concern for possible infection. His knee was warm ,
was tender and was erythematous , compared to the contralateral
side. As a result , the Orthopedic Service was again consulted.
An arthrocentesis was performed on his left knee , this was a dry
tap; no fluid was able to be obtained. The subsequent day , he
was complaining of increasing pain , and the sed rate returned in
the 99 with a CRP of 190. The EP Service again evaluated the
patient , and felt that there was no evidence of any clear
infection from the pacer site. He continued to have no erythema
or tenderness around the pacer site. His chest x-ray was
essentially unremarkable. The next day ( 10/9/05 ) , he was seen
by the Rheumatology Service , under Dr. Burris who also felt this
was most likely to be prepatellar bursitis , probably septic in
nature , with a hematoma. He was asked to seen by the Infectious
Disease Service , under Dr. Ferlic and Lou Marzinske
He was started on Ancef 1 gm q.8h. A PICC line will be placed
later today on the 5/15/05 and he will be discharged to rehab.
Of note , he has been afebrile for more than 48 hours while on the
Ancef , and his white count has improved dramatically , into the
approximately 10000 range. He will continue to get IV Ancef
q.8h. for an additional 12 days. New consultants on the case ,
again Dr. Hempe and Dr. Bradford Mcguigan with Infectious
Disease , Dr Borde and Dr. Frances Thackston with Orthopedics and Dr.
Gangwer with Rheumatology.
