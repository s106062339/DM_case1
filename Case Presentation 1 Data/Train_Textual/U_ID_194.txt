DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Acute cholecystitis.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:
1. Cardiomyopathy status post cardiac transplant.
2. Chronic renal insufficiency.
3. Hypothyroidism.
4. Diabetes mellitus.
5. Bile leak.
PROCEDURES:
1. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ).
2. Open cholecystectomy.
3. ERCP with biliary stenting.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 46-year-old man
status post cardiac transplant for familial cardiomyopathy who
presented with acute onset of epigastric and left upper quadrant
abdominal pain. The patient developed acute epigastric and left
upper quadrant pain after dinner the night prior to admission.

denied fevers and chills. In the emergency department , the
patient complained of severe abdominal pain and raving in bed.

was seen by the GI consult in the emergency department , and EGD
was done and showed gastroparesis. He was also seen by the
surgical consult who felt that he did not have an acute abdomen.
He then had a gastric emptying study , which showed only mildly

1. Ventral hernia containing nonobstructive transverse colon.
2. Nonspecific low-attenuation segment VII hepatic lesion
3. Oral contrast remains in the stomach.
KUB postcontrast: Oral contrast from the CT abdomen and pelvis
remains in the stomach suggesting possibility of gastric atony
versus outlet obstruction.

taken. Normal pylorus and normal duodenum.
KUB post-EGD: No free air or obstruction.
Gastric emptying study: Mildly delayed emptying , no reflux.
EKG: Normal sinus rhythm at 80 , normal axis and intervals , right
bundle-branch block , no ST or T-wave changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS: Following several studies in the
emergency department as well as consultations from the
gastroenterologist and the general surgeons , the patient was
thought to have abdominal pain secondary to gastroparesis given
the findings on the EGD and CT as well as the negative ultrasound
and KUB. The gastroparesis was thought to be secondary to his
diabetes. He was admitted to the medical service and his diet
was slowly increased. On the floor , his pain continued , and
within two to three days , he began spiking fevers to 101 to 102.
He had a repeat abdominal CT , which showed a distended
gallbladder with circumferential wall thickening and extensive
stranding of the pericholecystic fat , which represented acute
acalculous cholecystitis. Surgery was reconsulted , and the
patient was taken to the operating room where he had an
exploratory laparoscopy , which was then converted to an open
cholecystectomy for gangrenous cholecystitis. The patient
received perioperative vancomycin , Levaquin , and Flagyl and
continued to do well post surgery with advancement of his diet
and decrease in his pain medication requirement. Vancomycin was
discontinued on 4/14/2006 after six days of vancomycin. He was
continued on the Levaquin and Flagyl. He had a drain that was
left in following surgery , and this was pulled on 4/14/2006 .
Following the pulling of the drain , he developed leakage of
green-tinged serous fluid from his abdominal wound. An abdominal
CT was done which showed a small fluid collection and no abscess.
An ERCP was done which showed a cystic duct stump bile leak.
They did a biliary sphincterotomy and stenting with no further
leak. The patient was continued on empiric Levaquin and Flagyl
following the procedure. His diet was advanced and he tolerated
this well. He had no further pain. He is being discharged on a
total of seven days of Levaquin and Flagyl following the bile
leak.
Endocrine: The patient was continued on lower-dose insulin while
he was n.p.o. and this was titrated up as his diet increased.
Cardiovascular: The patient was followed by the cardiac
transplant team. He was initially switched to IV cyclosporine
and his CellCept was held. These were transitioned to p.o. and
restarted following his improvement. Postoperatively , he got
stress-dose hydrocortisone instead of his prednisone and this was
then tapered to Solu-Medrol and then back to prednisone at his
home dose. He was fluid overloaded following the surgery. He
got 100 of IV Lasix times several doses , and then restarted on
his torsemide to maintain euvolemia. His Cartia was initially
discontinued for a question of contribution to gastroparesis , but
this was then restarted. He was discharged on all his home
medications with the torsemide at a dose of 40 mg q.a.m.
Rheumatology: Following his surgery , he developed bilateral
elbow pain , which was thought to be likely secondary to gout.
The rheumatology service was consulted. A left elbow tap was
attempted , but this did not return any fluid. He was given
several doses of colchicine p.r.n. with improvement. The steroid
taper was slowed and his gout improved. He was discharged
without any elbow pain.
Phlebitis: He developed left arm phlebitis secondary to an
infiltrating IV. This was covered by his antibiotics that were
started for his cholecystitis and his arm improved.
FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS:
1. The patient will follow up with the cardiac transplant
service. This will be arranged by them.
2. The patient will need to follow up with Dr. Magdefrau from
general surgery ( 800-336-8213 ) to have his staples removed in two
weeks.
3. The patient will need to follow up with Dr. Vinion from
gastroenterology to schedule an appointment to have his stents
removed in six weeks.
4. The patient will continue to take his cardiac medications as
before. His torsemide is dosed now at 40 mg q.a.m.
5. The patient will continue on Levaquin and Flagyl as
prescribed for five days following discharge.
