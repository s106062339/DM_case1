BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a pleasant 78-year-old gentleman who presents with
shortness of breath and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea for
approximately three weeks. He has a history of coronary artery
disease with an MI in 1994 and four-vessel CABG with subsequently
placed five stents in 2002 for graft and native vessel stenosis ,
hypertension , chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline
creatinine of 2.8 , diabetes mellitus ( insulin dependent ) ,
hyperlipidemia , and a pace maker for symptomatic bradycardia. He
is presented with three weeks of increasing orthopnea , dyspnea ,
and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea with rare chest tightness
without radiation and onset of symptoms mainly while recumbent.
He presents after coming to an outside hospital with three to
four days of these worsening symptoms. He was transferred to
Baspit Hospital where he received most of his
cardiac care. The patient had these worsening heart failure
symptoms after a trip to I Hwy , Ny Vale , Michigan 34152 , some dietary indiscretion and
a five-pound weight gain. He has had no syncope , palpitations ,
but has had some mild nausea without emesis. At the outside
hospital when he presented , his EKG showed a baseline left
bundle-branch block and had a troponin of 0.13. He was given
some Lasix and had echocardiogram , had initially revealed an
ejection fraction of 35%. He was transferred to Me Ale Firstray Hospital , started on a nitroglycerin drip as well as a
heparin drip for presumed coronary artery disease , a repeat
echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 50% , anterior wall
distal dyskinesis from an old myocardial infarction and
moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. This is consistent with
an echocardiogram that he received in 1/8 . Upon
presentation , the patient was afebrile , had a heart rate of 82 ,
blood pressure of 138/64 and was sating 96% on 5 liters of nasal
canula. His jugular venous pressure was 7 cm. His lungs had
rales bilaterally , approximately half way up. He had no
dullness. His heart was regular rate and rhythm with a 3/6
holosystolic murmur at the apex with radiation to the left
axilla. He had no S3 , and no S4. His abdomen was mildly
distended. He had no fluid waves and positive bowel sounds. His
extremities were warm. He had no pedal edema and 1+ dorsalis
pedis pulses bilaterally. EKG at Baneers Hospital
revealed a dual chamber pacemaker with left bundle-branch pattern
and no significant ST wave changes and an occasional PVC.
ADMISSION LABORATORIES:
Significant for a creatinine of 3.1 , a BUN of 76 , potassium of
5.3 , his hematocrit was 29.4 , and PT-T was 56 on heparin drip.
BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Ischemia. The patient has an extensive history of coronary
artery disease. He is maintained on aspirin , Plavix , low dose
beta-blocker with carvedilol as well as ACE inhibitor and statin.
He initially came in with a troponin of 0.13 , which was felt as
demand ischemia related to systemic hypertension and pulmonary
hypertension. His enzymes trended down and were negative after
the initial check. Eventually , the patient received 48 hours of
intravenous heparin as well as IV nitroglycerin and was chest
pain free. At this point , he received an Adenosine MIBI nuclear
study , which revealed a known distal anterior wall scar with a
very small surrounding region of reversible ischemia that was
felt to be nonrevascularizable. He was maintained on optimum
medical management with the caveat that cardiac catheterization
in this gentleman who had already had previous history of renal
dysfunction with a creatinine rise to nearly 7 with a dye load
was not warranted nor indicated at this time. By discharge , he
was ambulating halls and was chest tightness free. Coronary
artery disease was felt to be a noncontributory factor to his CHF
exacerbation.
2. Pump. The patient had an ejection fraction of 45% upon
admission with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. He was
initially diuresed approximately 3 liters with a combination of
Lasix and Natrecor. At this point , his pulmonary edema had
resolved and his oxygen requirement was decreased. Given the
fact of his tenuous renal status , we wanted to avoid further
diuresis or after-load reduction until we knew exactly what his
right and left heart filling pressures were. The patient was
taken to the Cardiovascular Diagnostic Laboratory and received a
right heart catheterization. His pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure was determined to be 16 and his pulmonary artery
pressure 56/18. His RA pressure was 8. There was some initial
false elevation because of inadequate sedation while in the cath
lab , and the patient was transferred for 48 hours of tailored
therapy to the Cardiac Care Unit where he had a pulmonary artery
catheter in place. At this point , his after-load reduction was
maximized with combination of hydralazine and Isordil with good
effect. His creatinine decreased with after-load reduction to
2.7. His symptoms improved and we were able to diurese another 2
liters of the patient. By discharge , the patient was actually
becoming hypertensive again and he was started on amlodipine , a
calcium channel blocker , which he has tolerated in the past. Of
note , the patient has been exposed to ACE inhibition in the past
and is currently not on an ACE inhibitor. In the past , he had
had a rise in his potassium to 5.5 on ACE inhibition. On an
outpatient basis in the future , we would suggest the patient have
a trial of ACE or ARB to optimize his after-load reduction and
neurohormonal activation with his heart failure. The patient's
heart failure regimen includes standing Lasix , carvedilol ,
Isordil and hydralazine , as well as digoxin for symptomatic
improvement.
3. Rhythm. The patient has a dual-chambered pacemaker. He was
maintained on telemetry throughout his hospital stay. His
electrolytes were replete and he is on a low-dose beta-blocker.
He had a few rounds of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia less
than 8 beats every time during his hospital stay. The patient is
not at this time a candidate for resynchronization biventricular
pacer therapy because his ejection fraction of 45% , even if his
QRS interval is greater than 150 ms.
4. Pulmonary. Given the fact that the patient had a normal
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and elevated pulmonary artery
pressures , a brief investigation of pulmonary parenchymal disease
was undertaken. He had a high resolution chest CT , which showed
mild ground glass infiltrate at the bases consistent with
pulmonary edema and no evidence of interstitial process. He also
had pulmonary function tests. Pulmonary function tests revealed
an FVC of 1.88 liters and an FEV1 of 1.33 liters. This gives an
FEV1 to FVC percent of 71%. He has both decreased FVC and FEV1 ,
but an FEV1 and FVC percent that is most consistent with a mild
restriction. His lung volumes are approximately 50% predicted
suggestive of a restrictive process and his DLCO both corrected
and uncorrected are 50% predicted. His corrected DLCO is 13.5.
It is unclear if the patient has underlying restrictive lung
disease given the absence of definitive interstitial process on
high resolution chest CT. A more likely explanation for these
findings is a residual pulmonary edema relating to inadequate
diuresis with his congestive heart failure. The patient was
sating 98% on room air at the time of discharge.
5. Endocrine. The patient has very difficult to control
diabetes mellitus , and was maintained on both NPH and Lispro
sliding scale while in house. He was briefly hypoglycemic during
his initial hospital course because of a urinary tract infection.
This resolved after approximately 24 hours of holding his
long-acting insulin and giving him glucose replacement therapy.
He was euglycemic on 15 and 10 of NPH in the a.m. and p.m.
respectively as well as a Lispro scale at the time of discharge.
Furthermore , the patient was found to have a TSH of 0.219 as well
as a normal T4 , this is suggestive of clinical hypothyroidism ,
which is consistent with over replacement with Synthroid such as
maintenance Synthroid dose is decreased from 75 mcg to 60.5 mcg
and we recommend a TSH to be checked in late February 2004.
6. Renal. The patient has baseline chronic renal insufficiency
presumably due to a combination of diabetes and hypertension. He
has had adverse reaction to contrast dye in the past with a
creatinine bump to nearly 7. We wanted to avoid as much contrast
dye as possible during this hospital stay because of his renal
insufficiency. We ended up re-dosing his digoxin to three times
weekly from every other day because of the dig level of 0.19.
His creatinine was 2.7 and falling at the time of discharge and
his BUN was 67. He was making good urine and had no evidence of
residual urinary tract infection.
7. Infectious disease. Upon presentation , the patient after a
Foley was placed became a little delirious and hypoglycemic.
Urine cultures grew out greater than 100 , 000 colonies of Serratia
marcescens and he was given a 14-day course of renally dosed
levofloxacin with good resolution of his symptoms.
8. Neuropsych. The patient has a history of depression and had
some mild delirium in the setting of urinary tract infection ,
which resolved with p.r.n. Zyprexa as well as treating of the
underlying condition. Psychiatric Service was consulted and felt
like he had a resolving medical delirium and there is no
indication for further pharmacal or psychodynamic therapy at this
time. ( His mild subclinical hyperthyroidism may have contributed
to his low mood as apathetic hyperthyroidism in a gentleman of
this age is not uncommon. )
9. Prophylaxis. The patient was maintained on Nexium for GI
prophylaxis and subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
