MRI of the brain showed an acute right pontine infarct with mild
irregularity of the basilar artery.
Impression was L ataxic hemiparesis , which is clasically a lacunar stroke
syndrome caused by small vessel disease , however can be caused by an
embolism. Her hospital course has been stable.
Reversible stroke risk factor labs included:
HDL 32 , LDL 114 , TG 140 , homocysteine 15.9 , ESR 14 , HGBA1C 6.2
Based on these data , she should be on a statin. She should have tight
sugar monitoring , possibly with an oral agent. High homocysteine can be
treated with B complex vitamins with little side effect.
She should be on daily aspirin for secondary stroke
prevention. Echocardiogram showed no thrombus , normal LV size and
function , normal LA size. At the time of dictation , holter result was not
available , but this will be addressed in outpatient follow up.
She is being discharged to acute rehabilitation. She will benefit from
aggressive PT/OT treatment.
