BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
56M with SOB admitted on 3/30 .  Hx of ESRD on HD ,
CHF with EF of 25% , DM , HTN. Pt became acutely sob on 3/18 at rest ,
but then states sob for a few days. No cp , occasional epigastric
burning. +PND , sleeps on 1 pillow , no LE
edema. CV January Cath 90% LAD , 80% Ramus , 80% LCx. EF
25%. No chest pain complaints. +Troponin likely
due due demand ischemia from volume overload. Pt
on ASA , Lopressor which was increased over 2
days , Nitrates , and ACE-inh. Pt will maximize
medical management of CV status , and dialysis done 1/1 .
Cardiology Consult 1/1 for Troponin rising to 2.9 ?if CABG candidate ,
cards suggesting med mgt. Increased the lopressor with goal b/p
<130. Troponin max 2.99 on 1/1 .  RHcath after
dialysis 6/21 showed increased filling pressures
and adenosine mibi on 10/13 showed minimal ischemia
of inferior-lateral wall and ?defect in
anterior wall. Will switch to Toprol XL 200 QD 6/8 p
HD. 10/2 12 beats , and 6/21 7 beats VT. follow

tert. Hyper pth. Hyperkalemia without T wave peaking.
Kayexelate given with Lactulose with good results. Repeat
K improving , dialysis
MWF. PULM ) SOB with hypoxia on admission from CHF.
No clear infiltrates. Doing well on NC O2. On
review of Cxr there is ?consolidation LLL. If
spikes then culture and add pna
coverage. GI ) Constipation likely related to
hypercalcemia. Pt on agressive bowel
regimen. RENAL ) ESRD on HD. Dialysis per Renal team. Pt
did recieve Vit D recently which may also have con tributed to
hypercalcemia. ENDO ) Pt put on decreased NPH regimen. bs of
