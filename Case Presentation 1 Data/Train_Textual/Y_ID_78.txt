Assessment: 46F s/p gastric bypass and recent NSAID use p/w melena ,
LH , rel hypotension , found to have HCT 24 ( baseline 36 )
Hospital Course: The patient was admitted for GI bleeding and anemia.
She was transfused to units of pRBC's in ED for HCT=24-->28-->31-->28.
The patient was initially started on a nexium iv drip and then was
restarted on oral PPI once EGD was performed and no source of bleeding
could be identified ( as above ). The patient also underwent colonoscopy
which was normal. The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout
her hospital course and her symptoms of lightheadedness , palpitations and
shortness of breath fully resolved. No further episodes of melena
occured during her hospitalization. The patient was instructed to avoid
NSAIDs and to continue Protonix 40mg BID. The patient was instructed to
have her HCT rechecked at her PCP's office the following week and to call
the GI office for followup. Her iron studies ( fe 20 , TIBC 361 , Ferr 9 )
were consistent w/ iron deficiency and the pt was given an informational
sheet on good nutritional sources of iron for repletion.
CODE STATUS: FULL CONTACT:
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You were admitted for GI Bleeding and had an upper endoscopy and
colonoscopy to evaluate the source. Your upper endoscopy demonstrated
mild erosions in the esophagus , but did not identify a definite source of
bleeding. Your colonoscopy was normal.
- As the use of NSAIDs ( including Naproxen , Ibuprofen , feldene ) increases
the risk of GI Bleeding , you should no longer use these medications.
Tylenol is a safe alternative for pain control for you.
- You should have your hematocrit rechecked at your primary care
physician's office on Tuesday , November to ensure that your blood levels are
stable.
- Your iron stores are low because of your recent bleeding. I have given
you a handout listing good nutritional sources of iron.
- Please seek medical attention if the bleeding recurs or you develop
abdominal pain , lightheadedness , heart racing , shortness of breath or
fever.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
- Please recheck patient's hematocrit on November to confirm stability.
- Please recheck pt's iron studies to determine whether they recover
appropriately with nutritional iron supplementation.
