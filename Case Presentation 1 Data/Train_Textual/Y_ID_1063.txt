Discharge Date: 1/23/2002
Mr. Shinaberry is a 73-year-old gentleman who returned to Surgluthe Leon Calcner Healthcare to the emergency room on 8/20/02 with crescendo
spontaneous angina and shortness of breath. He is three and one
half months after a presentation with subacute left circumflex
thrombosis , ischemic mitral regurgitation , pulmonary edema and a
small nontransmural myocardial infarction. His angiography at that
time revealed diffuse coronary atherosclerosis with attenuation and
diffuse narrowing of the left anterior descending coronary artery
and a small codominant right coronary system with extensive diffuse
disease. Large circumflex system with focally severe and
additional diffuse but noncritical stenosis with superimposed
thrombus. Dilatation of the left circumflex resulted in extensive
dissection but with eventual achievement of a very good
angiographic and clinical result after placement of multiple stents
and that his course was that of gradual recovery and uneventful
return home.
He remained frail and limited prior to this admission and
approximately six weeks prior to admission , began to have
occasional pain and shortness of breath. He went to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory for intervention. He underwent a
rotablator procedure on 8/20/02 in the cath. laboratory which
resulted in perforation of circumflex coronary artery into the
pericardial space with extravasation of blood. He went into
cardiogenic shock which was alleviated by intra-aortic balloon pump
placement and was seen in consultation by the cardiac surgery
service for emergent coronary artery bypass grafting. He went to
the operating room on 8/20/02 where he underwent emergent coronary
artery revascularization. He sustained a retained rotablator burr
in the left circumflex system and a left circumflex perforation.
He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x 5 with left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery ,
saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery , saphenous
vein graft to the obtuse marginal #2 , #3 and #1 and removal of a
rotablator burr , repair of the left ventricular apex vent. site.
He came off bypass on 2 mcg of epinephrine and his intra-aortic
balloon pump. During his code in the cath. lab , the patient had
become hypotensive requiring intubation and intra-aortic balloon
pump placement as noted above. A Foley catheter was placed by the
urology service attending with much difficulty. His chest was left
open at the time of operation as the patient was coagulopathic and
Esmarch closure was placed.
His postoperative course: His coagulopathy was reversed with blood
products and his chest was closed without event on August , 02. He
was also seen in consultation by the diabetic management service to
help with his diabetic management. He continued to have
postoperative cardiac failure , remained on Dopamine , intra-aortic
balloon pump , was slowly weaned and diuresis ensued. His
intra-aortic balloon pump was removed on postoperative day three
uneventfully. He continued to make good improvement and was
extubated on postoperative day four and transferred to the
step-down unit. He had mild confusion but has had a history of
cerebrovascular accident in the past. He still requires diuresis.
Chest tubes remained in place for very high chest tube output. He
was seen in consultation by the vascular surgery service for his
severe peripheral vascular disease and painful right foot. He was
also continued to be followed by urologic service and his Foley was
left in place. He did have a bump in his BUN and creatinine and
renal consult was obtained and helps with management of his fluid
balance. He was also seen in consultation by the thoracic surgery
service for increased chest tube output , mainly from the right
pleural chest tube. His other chest tubes were discontinued
without any complications and his acute renal failure began to
resolve. He received Albumin and packed cells to correct
hypoalbuminemia and also his postoperative anemia along with Lasix
for diuresis. He continued to make slow improvement and advanced
nutritionally. He had a vascular MRI which was done as requested
by vascular surgery service in preparation for potential
revascularization to his right leg. He continued to improve. His
BUN and creatinine were 90/3.5 at their highest level and have been
slowly declining over the past several weeks to today's level of 47
for BUN and 1.3 for creatinine. He continues to have low blood
cell counts; his white blood cell count is 3 today and his
hematocrit is 32.8. Platelet count is 98. He will require
follow-up for these on a two times weekly basis. His MRI shows
mild irregularity of the distal abdominal aorta as well as the left
common iliac artery , mild narrowing over long segment about three
cm. over the right external iliac artery. There is moderate focal
narrowing in the right common femoral artery at the bifurcation
between the superficial femoral and deep femoral and there is
complete occlusion in the distal right superficial femoral artery
with reconstitution three cm further. Multiple areas of focal
narrowing are seen in the proximal and distal left superficial
femoral artery , high grade stenosis in the proximal left popliteal
artery. The posterior tibial artery on the right side is
completely occluded proximally. On the left side , there is high
grade stenosis in the anterior tibial proximally as well as
occlusion of the anterior tibial in the mid calf with
reconstitution distally and complete occlusion of the posterior
tibial artery at it's origin. Peroneal shows moderate posterior
stenosis. He has moderate to severe atherosclerotic disease in the
lower extremities with multiple areas of narrowing inclusion. He
is to follow-up with Dr. Erasmo Gayler , Division of Vascular
Surgery for revascularization of his lower extremities.
Mr. Leitman is to be discharged on the following medications:
Meclizine 20 mg once a day , simvastatin 10 mg once a day , Lopressor
25 mg three times a day , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg once a day ,

foot pain , Albuterol nebulizer 2.5 mg every 6 hours by neb for
wheezing , Atrovent nebulizer 0.5 mg four times a day for wheezing ,

He is to be discharged to the care of Dr. Emilio Wojtecki , Division
