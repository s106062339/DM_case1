ATTENDING: SATOW , DARNELL M.D.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
This is a 64-year-old woman with a history of nonischemic
cardiomyopathy who was admitted with increasing volume overload.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Ms. Schmittou was doing well until approximately two weeks prior to
admission when in the setting of dietary indiscretion she noticed
some shortness of breath and weight gain. She states that she
started to increase her Demadex from 200 mg in the morning and
150 mg in the afternoon to 200 mg b.i.d. without significant
diuresis. She has continued to participate in cardiac rehab
without significant difficulty. Her weight was stable at 174.
She did , however , noticed worsening of intermittent dyspnea on
exertion and orthopnea , although she denied PND or pedal edema.
She denied abdominal symptoms of bloating , no satiety , nausea or
vomiting. She denied chest pain , discomfort , palpitations ,
lightheadedness or syncope. She does have occasional chest
burning. She also noted burning in her feet bilaterally which
has previously been attributed to neuropathy. On the day of
admission , she presented to the Outpatient Clinic to have an
echocardiogram and repeat exercise stress test with oxygen
uptake. She exercised for 4 minutes and 32 seconds achieving a
peak heart of 90 beats per minute with a blood pressure of 100/64
and stopping secondary to fatigue. Her peak oxygen uptake was
only 9 mL per minute despite on RER of 1.09. This is essentially
unchanged from a prior exercise stress test one year ago.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Includes nonischemic cardiomyopathy diagnosed in 1996 , with clean
coronary catheterization at that point. She has history of
hypertension , hypertriglyceridemia , and left bundle-branch block
status post ICD and pacemaker placement. Her pacer is
biventricular. She also has a history of urine bleeding. She
had a recent hysteroscopy and laparoscopy which were
unremarkable.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Included lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily , Toprol 75 mg p.o. daily ,
Demadex 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Aldactone 25 mg daily , KCl 10 mEq
daily , allopurinol 100 mg daily , colchicine 0.6 mg daily and
Evista 60 mg daily.
ALLERGIES:
Penicillin.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
She was afebrile with heart rate of 72 , blood pressure of 104/66.
Her weight was 174. Her JVP was at approximately 16 cm of water
with hepatojugular reflux to the angle of the jaw. Her carotid
upstrokes were brisk without bruits. Her lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Her cardiac exam was regular in rate
and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 and audible S3. She has 2/6
systolic murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation. Her
abdominal exam was benign except for liver edge that is palpable
approximately two fingerbreadths below the costal margin. Her
extremities were noncyanotic with no clubbing or edema. They
were lukewarm.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
Unremarkable.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Noncontributory.
LABORATORY DATA:
Her most recent labs had showed a sodium of 138 , a potassium 3.9 ,
a BUN of 67 , a creatinine of 1.9 and glucose of 123. Her LFTs
were all normal except for mildly elevated bilirubin of 1.3. Her
last lipids showed a total cholesterol of 128 with 191
triglycerides and HDL of 31 and an LDL of 59. Her last CBC was
unremarkable. Her EKG shows an a-sensed V-paced rhythm at the
rate of 72 beats per minute.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
Cardiovascular: Ms. Helger is a 64-year-old female with
nonischemic cardiomyopathy and class II-III symptoms who
presented with worsening volume overload in the setting of
dietary indiscretion. Given that she is already maximized on her
outpatient diuretic dose and somewhat worsening of her renal
function , she was admitted for further diuresis with IV
torsemide. She was also admitted for the beginning of her
transplant evaluation for potential cardiac transplant. She was
initially started on IV torsemide 200 mg b.i.d. with a goal of 1
to 2 liters of diuresis per day. She was continued on digoxin
and switched over from lisinopril and captopril. Her medications
were adjusted to optimize her diuresis and avoid hypotensive
episodes. She did go for a right heart cath on this
hospitalization that showed increased RA pressure of 14 and a
wedge pressure of 35-44 with V wave. Her cardiac index was
calculated at 1.38. Her SVR was calculated at 1600. Her mixed
venous O2 sat was between 52% and 60% when the readings were
repeated. Given that she appeared quite well and Lasix drip was
started to accelerate her diuresis. She was maintained on
tailored therapy including nitrates for afterload reduction and
the up titration of her captopril. She did have impressive
diuresis on Lasix drip. Her transplant workup at this time
included PFTs that showed an FVC of 2.64 , which his 86% predicted
an FEV1 of 1.82 , which is 75% predicted and FEV1 to FVC ratio of
69%. Her corrected DLCO was 14.6 , which was 56% of predicted.
She did have as well a carotid duplex ultrasound showing no
significant stenosis in either carotid artery. Her ankle
brachial indices were greater than 1 in both lower extremities
and her leg pulse volume recording was all entirely normal. Her
24-hour urine collection showed a value of 920 mg over the total
volume which was in the normal range. She did continued to
respond reasonable well to the diuresis with the exception of a
few episodes of asymptomatic hypotension. Her creatinine did
begin to bump marginally indicating that she had likely been
slightly over diuresed. She subsequently stabilized and was
discharged on a stable dose of diuretics including torsemide 100
mg p.o. b.i.d.
Her other discharge medications include captopril 25 mg t.i.d. ,
Isordil 20 mg t.i.d. , Claritin , Coumadin 5 mg daily , thiamine and
multivitamin , colchicine , magnesium , Evista , Aldactone 25 mg
daily , digoxin 0.125 mg daily and allopurinol 100 mg daily ,
Toprol-XL 25 mg daily.
She was discharged with plan for regular follow up with her
outpatient cardiologist.
