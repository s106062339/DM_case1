Discharge Date: 2/3/1996
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE AND
MIXED MITRAL VALVE DISEASE
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Reda is an 87 year-old
woman with a history of coronary
artery disease , mitral regurgitation and multiple sclerosis. She
has been complaining of chest pain and pressure on exertion as well
as dyspnea on exertion associated with limitation of activity and
increasing sublingual nitroglycerin use for the six to seven months
prior to admission. Of note , the patient developed atrial
fibrillation , atrial flutter back in October , 1995. An
echocardiogram at that time demonstrated an ejection fraction of
40% , inferior hypokinesis , moderate mitral regurgitation , and a
left atrial size of 6.1 centimeters. The patient required
hospitalization in October , 1996 , for congestive heart failure. She
returned to the hospital in February , 1996 , with complaints of chest
pain at rest and shortness of breath. She was ruled out for
myocardial infarction at Tol Hospital and transferred to
Ana Vinerl Hospital , where she refused cardiac
catheterization. Echocardiogram at that time demonstrated an
ejection fraction of 45% , inferior , posterior and anterior septal
hypokinesis , mild to moderate mitral stenosis and moderate mitral
regurgitation. Again , there was left atrial enlargement measured
at 6.1 centimeters. The patient returned home and was doing well
until February , 1996 , when she developed headache , chest pain and
shortness of breath. She again presented to Beth's Community Memorial Hospital where
she was found to be in acute pulmonary edema. She was stabilized
and transferred to Crithouse County Medical Center for further
management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease ,
status post anterior myocardial infarction.
Mitral regurgitation. Mitral stenosis. Atrial fibrillation.
Hypertension. Hypothyroidism. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Peptic ulcer disease. Normocytic anemia. Polymyalgia rheumatica.
History of left humeral fracture. She is status post appendectomy ,
cholecystectomy , and laser therapy for retinal disease of the right
eye.
ALLERGIES: Erythromycin , which causes vomiting and hypertension ,
as well as to sulfa drugs which cause vomiting. She
has a possible allergy to penicillin as well.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Synthroid 100 micrograms p.o. q.d.;
Lasix 40 milligrams p.o. q.d.; Axid 150
milligrams p.o. b.i.d.; aspirin 325 milligrams p.o. q.d.;

q.d.; Vasotec 5 milligrams p.o. b.i.d.; Zocor 10 milligrams p.o.
q.d.; Lopressor 25 milligrams p.o. q.i.d.; Isordil 10 milligrams
p.o. t.i.d.; Coumadin alternating 1 and 2 milligrams q.d. On
transfer , the patient was also on intravenous heparin and
Nitropaste.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She is widowed and retired. She has no smoking
or alcohol history.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is in atrial fibrillation at a rate of
83. Her blood pressure is 100/60 and is 95%
on room air. HEENT: Significant for upper and lower dentures
without any oropharyngeal lesions. NECK: Supple with 2+ carotid
pulses and no bruits. LUNGS: Bibasilar crackles. CARDIOVASCULAR:
Irregularly irregular rate and rhythm. Normal S1/S2. III/VI
holosystolic murmur radiating from the apex to the axilla. ABDOMEN:
Soft , nontender , obese. EXTREMITIES: Without cyanosis , clubbing
or edema. There are varicosities in bilateral lower extremities
with minimal varicosities over the thigh areas. There is bilateral
knee swelling. Pedal pulses are 1+ bilaterally. NEUROLOGICAL:
Nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: BUN is 35 , creatinine 1.5. White blood cell count
8.3. Hematocrit 32. PT 11.9 , PTT 28.4.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Jeffganlanda Py Docweli Skiffle Community Hospital Cardiology Service , where she
was maximized medically. The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization on January , 1996 , where she was noted to have
right coronary artery stenosis in the mid portion which was 50% and
distally had 80%. Finally , 90% with subtotal occlusion after the
posterior descending artery. The left anterior descending artery
had 40% stenosis after diagonal 1. Diagonal 1 itself had 90%
stenosis in the mid portion. The left circumflex had a 70%
stenosis at the mid portion and another 70% stenotic area at the
distal portion. Left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated
at 45%. Inferior hypokinesis was noted as was 3-4+ mitral
regurgitation. Right atrial pressures were 6 , right ventricle was
52/10 , pulmonary artery 52/22 , with mean of 33 , pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure was 27 and left ventricle was 160/16. The patient
was evaluated by the Cardiac Surgical Service for coronary artery
bypass grafting and replacement of her mitral valve. On March , 1996 , the patient was taken to the Operating Room where she
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times four with saphenous
vein graft to posterior descending artery , saphenous vein graft to
obtuse marginal one , saphenous vein graft to left anterior
descending artery , diagonal one and to left anterior descending
artery. She also had mitral valve replacement with 31 millimeter
Hancock. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred postoperatively to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit on
nitroglycerin , Dopamine drip. She was weaned to extubate without
difficulty. She was restarted on Captopril and digoxin as well as
Coumadin. The patient had minimal response to diuretics ,
associated with a rise in her creatinine to 1.9. The Captopril was
discontinued and the creatinine returned again to 1.3. Although
the chest x-ray demonstrated small bilateral pleural effusions , the
patient did not require aggressive diuresis initially as she had
excellent oxygenation on room air. Of note the patient was not
restarted on Lopressor as her blood pressures remained in the
90-100 range. The patient was , however , started on her prednisone
at 5 milligrams p.o. q.d. as well as on her Synthroid. Chest tubes
and invasive monitoring were discontinued early in the patient's
hospital course and she was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day number four. The patient was followed by
physical therapy and occupational therapy for progression of her
mobility. She was determined to benefit from intensive
rehabilitation at a facility.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was ambulating with
assistance. She was tolerating a regular
diet. She was seen to be in atrial fibrillation but ventricular
response was well controlled in the 60s to 70s. Of note , her
electrocardiogram demonstrated persistent right bundle branch block
as well as a left anterior fascicular block. Although the patient
had been receiving more than her normal doses of Coumadin , her INR
had not reached the therapeutic range. She was , however ,
therapeutic on heparin.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be transferred to a facility for
intensive conditioning and rehabilitation. There she
will continue to receive her heparin until she is therapeutic on
her Coumadin. Coumadin dosing will be handled by primary care
doctor , Dr. Corey Updegraff , or a physician at the rehabilitation
center. Dr. Turks 's number is 250-940-9571. The goal INR is 2
to 2.5. The patient will also require follow-up chest x-rays as
prior to discharge , her chest x-ray demonstrated bilateral pleural
effusions which were small and were not compromising her
respiration at all.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol #3 one to two tablets p.o. q.3-4h.
p.r.n. pain; digoxin 0.125 milligrams p.o.
q.d.; Colace 100 milligrams p.o. t.i.d. while taking Tylenol #3;
Lasix 80 milligrams p.o. q.d. to be continued initially but may be
discontinued at the discretion of the primary care or cardiology
physicians , pending the resolution of the pleural effusions and her
respiratory status; Synthroid 150 micrograms p.o. q.d. The patient
will require thyroid function tests in four weeks. Multivitamin
one tablet p.o. q.d.; Coumadin , dose to be determined by the
patient's INR , again the goal is 2 to 2.5. The patient received 4
milligrams on September , and 3 milligrams on September , and her
INR on September is 1.3. Axid 150 milligrams p.o. b.i.d.; K-Dur
10 mEq p.o. q.d. , potassium will also need to be monitored while
she is on the Lasix; intravenous heparin 800 units per hour with a
PTT goal of 50-60. The patient's PTT today on this dosing is 54.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient should follow-up with Dr. Kale in four to
six weeks , with Dr. Nicklas in two weeks , and with Dr.
Etheredge in one to two weeks.
