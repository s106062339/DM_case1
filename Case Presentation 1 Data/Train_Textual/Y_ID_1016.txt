HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Cliff Lucas Man Mcnease is a 52 year old Asian
male with known coronary artery
disease and extensive cardiac history , including: ( 1 ) In 1988 , the
patient had a CABG x2 vessels ( LIMA to LAD and RIMA to PDA ); ( 2 )
PTCA to PDA in 1994; ( 3 ) PTCA of LAD ( proximal to LIMA and left
circumflex ) including stent in 10/6 The patient discharged
himself AMA at that time. ( 4 ) The patient was admitted on 10/17/98
for symptoms consistent with CHF. He had a dobutamine MIBI at that
time , which was markedly positive with significant ST changes in
the inferior leads. He underwent a cardiac catheterization , where
a 90% long instant restenosis was found in the left circumflex.
The area was rotablated , and then angioplastied. During the
procedure , the patient experienced episodes of asystole. A V-pacer
was placed. The pacer was D/C'd the next morning , and the patient
was discharged home on 11/17/98.
Since that time , the patient states he has been pain free , except
when he exercises on the treadmill. He , therefore , takes one
sublingual nitroglycerin before and one after the treadmill.
However , the patient now reports that he has developed rest angina
over the past two weeks. The patient states that he has q. day
rest pain , with approximately 1-3 episodes per day relieved by one
sublingual nitroglycerin and lasting for minutes of each episode.
On the day of admission , the patient presented to his primary care
doctor at HEH for upper respiratory infection symptoms , which
started approximately on 7/15/98. The patient felt chest pain
again while walking up the stairs to his doctor's office. He
reported this to the doctor , and was sent to Cater Hospital for further evaluation.
On presentation , he denies nausea , vomiting , or arm tingling. He
does report occasional shortness of breath and intermittent
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , ? no orthopnea. He sleeps with one
pillow. His other review of systems was positive for productive
cough over the past week , yellow phlegm , no fevers or chills ,
diarrhea , or other. He was pain free in the Emergency Room. The
patient was therefore admitted with a diagnosis of unstable angina
for further evaluation. He was heparinized in the Emergency Room.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ( 1 ) Coronary artery disease status post a
CABG in 1988; ( 2 ) PTCA in 1994; ( 3 ) Status
post rotablation in 11/25 ( 4 ) Hyperlipidemia; ( 5 ) Focal/segmental
glomerulosclerosis. His peak creatinine was 3.4 after his last
dye; ( 6 ) Chronic renal insufficiency; ( 7 ) Gout; ( 8 ) Status post lap
cholecystectomy in 1997; ( 9 ) No history of diabetes mellitus.
MEDICATIONS: Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d.; Lopressor 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d.; Ecotrin 325 mg p.o. q.d.; nitroglycerin SL
p.r.n.; simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.d.; Vitamin E 400 U p.o. q.d.;
Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q.d.; allopurinol 200 mg p.o. q.d.
ALLERGIES: He is allergic to Naprosyn , which causes renal
dysfunction.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He has a history of four packs per day for 20
years and quit years ago. No alcohol or other
drugs.
FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for a sister status post CABG.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temp 97.8 , heart rate 67 , BP
146/98 , satting 95% on two liters. GENERAL:
This is an Asian male in no apparent distress. HEENT: His eyes
were anicteric , PERRL , EOMI. Oropharynx showed moist mucous
membranes. NECK: JVP approximately 10-11 cm of water , with no
bruit. HEART: He had a II/VI systolic ejection murmur in the
right and left upper sternal border , and positive S4 , no S3.
LUNGS: Rales 1/2 to 3/4 of the way up on the left side. The right
was clear to auscultation. ABDOMEN: Obese. He had bowel sounds
and no masses. EXTREMITIES: No clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. He
had 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
LABORATORY DATA: Chest x-ray was a poor film. It was an AP done
only. It showed no obvious infiltrates. EKG
showed sinus brady- , with first degree AV block and no acute ST or
T-wave changes. Laboratories on admission showed a BUN and
creatinine of 9 and 1.4. White count 6.37 , hematocrit 43 ,
platelet count 146. CK 90 , troponin-I 0.06. His protein was 12.3 ,
INR 1.1 , PTT 32.7.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. Sunier was subsequently admitted for R/O MI , and
unstable angina. The patient was did R/O for MI
by EKG and enzymes. He was heparinized and continued on all of his
medications that he presented on , and he was also continued on
nitropaste sliding scale to keep him pain free.
On hospital day #1 , the nitropaste was taken off , given that the
patient had a headache. In the evening , however , the cross-cover
intern was called as the patient developed 4 out of 10 chest pain
with deep breathing , which the patient stated felt like his typical
angina. Therefore , the nitropaste was restarted and the patient
was pain free within approximately two minutes.
The patient underwent an echocardiogram on hospital day #2 , which
showed an EF of 60-65% , 1+ MR , and borderline inferior hypokinesis.
He had an ETT MIBI done on 9/17/98. He exercise approximately 9
minutes and 45 seconds and stopped secondary to his chest pain and
fatigue. His peak heart rate was 89 , and BP 170/98. He had
horizontal downsloping of 1 mm , ST depression in the inferior leads
and V5-V6 , which was persistent in recovery. He got one sublingual
nitroglycerin given. On the images , it showed: ( 1 ) Moderate to
severe ischemia of the inferior wall and the posterior septum ( RCA )
7 out of 20 segments; ( 2 ) Mild ischemia of the anterior wall and
septum ( LAD ) 4 out of 20 segments; ( 3 ) An EF of 59%. The patient
was continued on heparin , nitropaste , and aspirin , and was sent for
cardiac catheterization on hospital day #3. Cardiac
catheterization showed: ( 1 ) A left main which was okay;
( 2 ) Totally occluded RCA; ( 3 ) Totally occluded LAD after the D1;
( 4 ) His left circ was 30-40% with a mid instant occlusion; ( 5 ) LIMA
to LAD was patent; ( 6 ) A treated LIMA , gaze TNG arrow patent;
( 7 ) Status post RIMA PTCA/stenting with significant spasm of the
entire RIMA. The patient , therefore , had a LIMA to PTCA stenting
performed and underwent some vasospasm on cardiac catheterization.
However , he was given Isordil and nifedipine for the spasm , which
resolved. The patient was in stable condition and pain free after
the catheterization and did not develop any complications such as a
hematoma or otherwise.
The patient was discharged to his home on 9/19/99 in stable
condition.
