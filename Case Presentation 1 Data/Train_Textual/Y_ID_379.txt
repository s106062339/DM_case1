Discharge Date: 2/4/1992
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE , STATUS POST
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
OTHER DIAGNOSES: 1. STATUS POST ATHERECTOMY COMPLICATED BY
REOCCLUSION AND MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
2. INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS.
3. ELEVATED CHOLESTEROL.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 59 year old female
with multiple cardiac risk factors who
presents with exertional chest discomfort and early positive ETT.
The patient has a history of cardiac risk factors of obesity ,
diabetes mellitus , and cholesterol. The patient describes a
6-month history of exertional angina described as chest heaviness
with mild shortness of breath whenever she walked more than one
block or climbed stairs. The patient is followed by Dr. Garrett H Lipkind , LMD at Skaemp Center .  She had an ETT on
5/23/92 , modified Bruce protocol , in which she went 2 minutes and 2
seconds , stopped secondary to typical anterior chest discomfort.
The heart rate was 135 , 83% predicted. EKG changes were
significant for 20 mm horizontal ST depressions in 1 , V4-5 , 1 mm ST
depressions in II , III and F. The patient was referred for cardiac
catheterization. The patient denies orthopnea , PND , and has mild
occasoinal hypertension. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Noninsulin
dependent diabetes mellitus , oral agent times six months. Asthma ,
no recent symptoms. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Glucotrol 7.5 mg
p.o. q-day , Mevacor 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Isoril 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
Propranolol 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Nitroglycerin sublingual p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: ? ALLERGY TO UNRECALLED ANTIBIOTIC. FAMILY HISTORY:
Brother required CABG in his 50's , mother died of heart disease ,
age unknown.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure 140/70 , pulse 70. Neck:
negative JVD , 2+ carotids , without bruits.
Chest: Clear to auscultation. Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm ,
S1 and S2 , a I/IV systolic ejection murmur heard best at the right
sternal border. Abdomen: Plus bowel sounds , nontender.
Extremities: +2 femorals , no bruits , positive left DP , trace PT ,
right positive 2 DP and plus 2 PT.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: BUN/creatinine 12/1.2 , glucose 318 ,
hematocrit 42.3 , white blood cell count
8.38 , cholesterol 222 , triglycerides 173.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent catheterization on 1/15/92 .
She had a proximal 95% LAD lesion and diagonal 1
40% stenosis. She had an anomalous posterior circumflex with
luminal irregularities. Her mean RA was 5 , and her mean capillary
wedge pressure was 11. Her cardiac output was 6.2 , wifh an FCR of
1226. The patient underwent athrectomy of her proximal LAD lesion
through a 10 French arterial sheath. The stenosis was reduced
from an 80% to 20% residual. The Heparin was shut off , and
sheaths were pulled later that afternoon. Her post atherectomy
course was complicated on the evening of 11/12/92 by the onset of
severe chest discomfort. The patient had significant flipped
T-waves in III and F and 2 mm ST depressions as well in III and F.
The patient was subsequently brought to the cath lab on 11/12/92
where the LAD was found to be 100% occluded and was dilated to a
30% residual with balloon PTCA. Thrombus was found at the prior
athrectomy site. The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Care
Unit after the PTCA which she proceeded to rule in for a myocardial
infarction with peak CPK's of 1390 with MB's of 55. The patient's
post PTCA course was complicated by several episodes of transient
chest discomfort which was relieved both by Mylanta and sublingual
TNG. These episodes were not compared with EKG nor felt to be
secondary to recurrent dyspepsia. The patient on 2/9/92 , seven
days post MI , had a modified Bruce ETT where she went 9 minutes
without any ischemic changes. The patient's blood sugars remained
elevated throughout her hospital course. She was maintained on
Glucotrol with NPH subcu q.a.m. was added with the hope that the
patient would eventually after the stress of her MI , her blood
sugars would return to prior levels. The patient was thus treated
with Mevacor for hypercholesterolemia. The patient was discharged
in good condition on 10/10/92 with followup with Dr. Kneisel in Frejames Ny'smiss Hospital .
DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Mevacor 10 mg p.o. q-day ,
Aspirin one p.o. q-day , Glucotrol 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
Isordil 40 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lopressor 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. , NPH 26
units subcutaneously each morning.
