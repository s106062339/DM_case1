Discharge Date: 10/9/2005
ATTENDING: KEVIN DEPIPPO MD
PRIMARY MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS:
Congestive heart failure.
OTHER MEDICAL DIAGNOSES:
Morbid obesity , hypothyroidism , hypertension , history of poor
adherence to medical regimen.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with medical history as
mentioned above and history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy with her
last echocardiogram in 6/22 showing ejection fraction of 35-45%.
She presents with approximately 1.5 weeks of increasing
shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion. The patient denies
chest pain , fevers or chills but does say that she has had sore
throat and a cough for approximately one week. The cough is
productive of clear frothy sputum. The patient reports
compliance with most of her medicines but states that she is not
taking Synthroid and lisinopril because these medications make
her feel bad. She also reports eating submarine sandwiches for
the past week secondary to difficulty shopping and doing her
cooking at home. She does not measure her daily weights. She
states that in addition to the Synthroid and lisinopril , she is
unsure of her other medical regimen as she has run out of some of
her medicines at home.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
As above.
ALLERGIES:
Ampicillin causes a rash.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient has two adult children at home and reports that she
drinks approximately 1/2-1 pint of ethanol over 2-3 days and
binges that occur approximately two times per month.
ADMISSION DATA:
Vital signs: Temperature 97 , pulse 76 , blood pressure 150s/80s.
note that one read with a small cuff read a blood pressure of
200/100 , this was believed to be secondary to inefficient cuff
size. Oxygen saturation 94% on room air. In general , the
patient is morbidly obese , in no acute distress , slowly
responsive to questions with frequent staring episodes. HEENT
exam was significant for mild pharyngeal erythema without
exudates. Neck exam was significant for no lymphadenopathy.
Jugular venous pressure was elevated although it is difficult to
assess secondary to body habitus. Lungs showed clear breath
sounds although a few crackles were present at the left base.
Abdomen was morbidly obese but did have active bowel sounds and
was nontender. Extremities showed significant subcutaneous fatty
tissue , however , there was no pitting edema. Extremities were
warm throughout. Dermatologic exam was significant for dry skin
and thin eyebrows. Neuro exam revealed 3+ biceps reflexes
bilaterally. There was a question of slow relaxation phase.
Chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary redistribution. EKG was
unchanged from prior , and showed normal sinus rhythm with a first
degree AV block , left axis deviation , left ventricular
hypertrophy with poor R-wave progression and nonspecific T-wave
abnormalities.
Laboratory values on admission was significant for creatinine of
0.8 , D-dimer was negative at 306 , BNP 2. White blood cell 6.9 ,
hematocrit 43.6 , platelets 170 , 000 , magnesium 1.7 , potassium 3.2 ,
INR 0.9 , PTT 29.3.
INITIAL IMPRESSION:
This is a 58-year-old woman with morbid obesity , dilated
cardiomyopathy and hypothyroidism in the setting of poor medical
compliance , admitted with likely multifactorial dyspnea on
exertion and mild congestive heart failure and decompensation.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:
Pump: The patient presented with an elevated JVP in the setting
of a negative BNP. However the clinical exam was more consistent
with mild failure and the patient was diuresed with 80 mg of IV
Lasix. She responded to this dose with good urine output and
stable renal function test. However , secondary to stress
incontinence and difficulty measuring JVP , the patient was
slightly over diuresed while inhouse resulting in an increasing
BUN to creatinine ratio. On her final day of her
hospitalization , all diuretics were held and the patient was
discharged on her usual regimen of diuretics including Lasix 80
mg once per day. The patient had been noncompliant with her
lisinopril secondary to throat symptoms and reportedly some
lightheadedness. Therefore she was changed to Cozaar 50 mg at
the time of discharge. The patient's discharge weight was 141.5
kg and this was estimated to be dry weight for the patient at
this time.
Rhythm: The patient had first degree AV block that was stable
from old EKGs. She was monitored on telemetry throughout her
hospital stay. There were no significant events on telemetry
during this hospitalization.
Ischemia: Rule out MI protocol was initiated in the ED secondary
to vague symptoms. This was continued and the patient ruled out
with serial negative cardiac enzymes x 3. there was no
suggestion of ischemic by ECG criteria as well.
2. Endocrine: The patient has a long history of noncompliance
with her thyroid hormone replacement and was clearly hypothyroid
on this admission. However , secondary to difficulty with blood
draws , thyroid function tests that were ordered were not obtained
on this admission and should be obtained as an outpatient in the
near future. the patient was encouraged to continue taking her
thyroid medicine as this may help improve her overall functional
status in addition to her cardiomyopathy.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d. , folate 1 mg p.o. q.d. , potassium chloride
20 mEq p.o. q.d. , Prozac 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Ventolin 2 puffs
aerosol as needed , levothyroxine 225 mcg p.o. q.d. , multivitamin tablet
p.o. q.d. , Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Colace 100 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , Flonase 1-2 puffs in the
nose twice a day , Advair Diskus one puff twice a day , Aldactone
one tablet p.o. q.d. , atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
FOLLOWUP PLANS:
The patient will have a followup in SNOWEST HOSPITAL clinic with her primary
care provider , the day following discharge , since Wednesday
8/6/05. at this time , routine chem-7 can be obtained to
evaluate for improvement in renal function and electrolyte
status. The patient will followup with her cardiologist , Dr.
Roik at her regularly scheduled intervals. Tests pending at the
time of discharge , the patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram
performed which is pending at the time of this dictation. The
patient is discharged to home with services in good condition.
