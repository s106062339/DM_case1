HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Cabaniss is a 70-year-old woman with
a history of yellow nail syndrome ,
hypertension , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes ,
who has had multiple admissions since October 2001. The first was
an admission to an outside hospital from 5/25/01 - 11/20/01.
At that time , she had increased shortness of breath , and was
diagnosed with bilateral pleural effusions and a pericardial
effusion. She had a pericardial window and 600 cc were drained
from her pericardium , as well as pleural effusions drained. She
was discharged at that time with a diagnosis of congestive heart
failure , secondary to cor pulmonale. The second admission was
from 8/28/01 - 8/10/01 at the Aen Medical Center . At that time , she had
increased lower extremity edema. She was diuresed during that
admission , and again her pleural effusions were tapped. An
echocardiogram at that time revealed mild LVH , an ejection fraction
of 55-60% , no wall motion abnormalities and a moderate-large
pericardial effusion with fibrinous strands.
A catheterization of her left and right heart revealed a right
atrial pressure of 5 , an RV pressure of 45/11 , PA pressures of
38/18 and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 22 , LV pressure
was 127/14. There was no constrictive pericardial disease or
restrictive cardiomyopathy. She also had no malignant cells in her
pleural effusion , which was exudated. ANCA , ANA , SPEP were
negative. She also had a renal ultrasound that was without mass or
hydronephrosis , 24 hour urine collection with decreased protein.
The third admission was at Beysa Dward Hospital from 11/15/01 - 1/16/01 , for
increasing shortness of breath and increasing lower extremity
edema. At that time she was diuresed , found to be iron deficient.
She had bilateral thoracentesis , which revealed exudative
effusions. PFTs revealed a FEV1 of .9 , 40% of predicted , an FVC of
1.26 , 43% of predicted , an FEV1/FVC ratio of 93% , a TLC of 2.07 ,
40% of predicted , and a DLCO of 8.42 , also 40% of predicted. She
was ruled out for TB with serial ASBs during this admission.
She was also diagnosed with yellow nail syndrome at that time ,
consisting of the clinical syndrome of recurrent pleural effusions ,
lymphedema and yellow fingernails. She was started on high dose
Vitamin E , and evaluated by CT surgery for a possible pleurodesis.
However , she was sent home at that time with an increased dose of
diuretics.
Since her discharge in July , she has been aggressively diuresed ,
but the diuretics were stopped secondary to hyperkalemia. In September
2001 , she was found to have a 10 pound weight gain and was
restarted on Lasix. Over the week prior to admission , she has had
increasing dyspnea on exertion. She has baseline shortness of
breath and orthopnea , but her orthopnea has also worsened. Her
weight at discharge in July was 208 , and on admission she
currently weighs 238 , and was 231 pounds a month prior to
admission. She denies wheezing , but does have a chronic cough with
white sputum. She has had some substernal chest pain that is sharp
with dyspnea on exertion , which lasts for awhile without radiation.
She also has increasing lower extremity edema. In the emergency
department , she was found to be afebrile , heart rate 103 ,
respiratory rate 24 , blood pressure 95/41 and satting 91% on 2
liters. She was given Albuterol and Atrovent nebs without
improvement and Lasix 160 mg IV with a 600 cc diuresis.

SUMMARY: This is a 70-year-old woman with history of hypertension ,
diabetes , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , home 02
requirement and yellow nail syndrome. She was admitted with
increasing dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea and a weight gain over
the past week prior to admission. She has most likely had a
failure of home diuretics , and needed to have her effusions tapped
along with some definitive therapy for her yellow nail syndrome in
terms of recurrent pleural effusions.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Pulmonary. We initially diuresed Ms. Jowell
with IV Lasix , along with Diuril. She had brisk
diuresis overnight , but was still short of breath the next day. On
hospital day #2 , we did a thoracentesis on her right side and were
able to remove 1.5 liters of clear , yellowish fluid. The fluid was
sent for cytology , as well as chemistries and returned as an
exudative effusion with predominant lymphocytes. The cytology was
negative for any malignant cells. The pulmonary team was
consulted , who decided that she would benefit from a pleurodesis to
prevent effusions from recurring. We consulted thoracic surgery ,
who requested a CT scan after a thoracentesis to assess her lungs
for evidence of malignancy.
CT scan was done on 9/19/01 , but due to atelectasis and having to
do the study without IV contrast , there were areas in her right and
left lungs that appeared nodular or opacified and could have been
malignancies. CT surgery also requested cardiac clearance before
any definitive surgical therapy was done due to new onset SVT. We obtained a
stress MIBI. On 9/4/01 , she was taken to the operating room for surgery
of the right chest. At that time , Dr. Women , the cardiothoracic
surgeon took biopsies of her pleura , which were reportedly
thickened and yellow. She also took a wedge biopsy of the right
lower lobe. Those biopsies have returned , and revealed mild
nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis with chronic bronchiolitis.
The diaphragm was also biopsied , and was determined to be lymphoid
tissue in a fibrous tissue fragment. She had a chest tube placed
at the time of operation and tolerated that well. However , after that
procedure , she was deemed unstable by the PACU team and was
admitted to MICU overnight. She extubated without problems and
remained on a few liters of oxygen overnight , with oxygen
saturations in the 90%. She was readmitted to the medicine team
on the following day , 8/28/01. Overall , she tolerated that
procedure well. Her chest tube that was placed on the right side
did not drain much fluid over the next few days. However , the
pleural effusion on the left side , did increase in size and we did
a thoracentesis on 8/28/01. We removed 1 liter of turbid ,
yellowish brown fluid. The chemistries revealed a lymphocyte and
macrophage predominance and the cytology is still pending at this
time. As her chest tube was not draining much fluid , the thoracic
surgery team decided to pleurodese her with doxycycline , which has
shown to be effective in yellow nail syndrome in patient's 70% of
the time. The pleurodesis was on 3/29/01. She tolerated this
procedure well , and had little chest tube drainage over the next 48
hours. The chest tube was pulled on 6/2/01.
Mrs. Musson 's shortness of breath was much improved after the
initial thoracentesis on the right , and she is currently on her
home oxygen requirement of 2 liters , satting in the mid-90%. The
plan is for her to see Dr. Colasante in 2 weeks and also have a
follow-up chest x-ray. At that time , Dr. Ostermann will determine if
there is fluid reaccumulating on the right after the pleurodesis.
She can then have a repeat pleurodesis on the right , or an initial
pleurodesis on the left.
2. Cardiovascular. Mrs. Blan was tachycardic on admission , and
continued to be tachycardic throughout the admission. She was
initially diuresed with IV Lasix and Diuril , and was probably over
diuresed , a total of 2-3 liters over a number of hours overnight.
On hospital day #2 , she was found to be tachycardic with rates in
the 140s-150s and atrial fibrillation. She converted back to
normal sinus rhythm with 3 doses of IV calcium channel blockers and
a Diltiazem drip. She was then maintained on Diltiazem SR 60 mg PO
b.i.d. throughout the admission and remained in normal sinus
rhythm. However , her tachycardia was noted to be multifocal HL
tachycardia during her MICU admission. At the time of admission ,
we did a pulsus which was only 8 mmhg. She had a bedside
echocardiogram to rule out a pericardial effusion , which revealed a
trace pericardial effusion. She also had a dobutamine MIBI for
cardiac clearance for the cardiothoracic surgical procedure. Her
heart rate increased from 107-129 , and the blood pressure decreased
from 115/70 - 110/70 at peak stress. The clinical response to
dobutamine was non-ischemic , the blood pressure response was
normal , and the EKG response to dobutamine was non-ischemic. There
were no definite regional perfusion defects seen on the stress or
rest images. However , only planer images could be obtained , due to
difficulty with positioning of the patient's left arm. Her results
were determined to be normal , and suggestive of no evidence of
hemodynamically secondary CAD , although the study was technically
limited.
In terms of her diuresis , Ms. Duensing was kept on IV Lasix for only
the first few days of her admission , and then was switched to PO
diuretics. Initially at a dose of 200 mg PO b.i.d. , and then
decreased to 120 mg PO b.i.d. Her lower extremity edema decreased
significantly , along with her pleural effusions.
3. Renal. Ms. Handy 's baseline creatinine is 1.7 , her creatinine
throughout her admission varied between 1.6-1.9. We caused a mild
contraction alkalosis with diuretics , but were able to replete her
electrolytes as needed. She will follow with Dr. Svinth for her
renal insufficiency as an outpatient.
4. Endocrine. Ms. Reppell has type II diabetes and was on glyburide
5 mg q. d. as an outpatient. She continued that therapy as an
inpatient , and her finger sticks were in good control during this
admission.
5. Rheumatology. Ms. Chad has a history of gout , and we were
concerned about precipitating a gout attack with the aggressive
diuresis. We continued her colchicine and decreased her
allopurinol to 200 mg PO q. d. We also continued her Vitamin E
therapy for the yellow nail syndrome.
6. Hematology. She has chronic anemia , and we continued her iron
and Procrit treatment during the admission.
DISPOSITION: Ms. Souza will be discharged to home with VNA
services to administer her twice weekly Procrit doses , and physical
therapy to aid her in regain her strength and range of motion in
her joints infected with gout. She has been instructed to make
follow-up appointments with Dr. Amicone in a few weeks , and to have
a chest x-ray on the day that she sees Dr. Burchell She should also
follow-up with Dr. Donkin in the renal clinic.
