Discharge Date: 8/5/2007
ATTENDING: TALSKY , JARVIS CLAIR M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Diabetes.
ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSES: Cirrhosis and IPF.
SERVICES: GMS Chi
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 76-year-old female
with a history of IPF , on home oxygen at 3 l nasal cannula at
baseline , cryptogenic cirrhosis , and insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus who was recently admitted from 9/10/07 through 4/28/07
for hyperglycemia and volume overload , who presented with
hyperglycemia and weight gain. Of note , during the patient's
previous admission , she was diagnosed with a urinary tract
infection as well as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis based on a
diagnostic paracentesis , which showed greater than 250
neutrophils. During that admission , the patient was treated for
a urinary tract infection and the SBP and was sent home on a
course of oral cefpodoxime. Of note , during that previous
admission , the patient was also hyperglycemic and was discharged
on an insulin regimen of Lantus 90 with good aspartate sliding
scale. At home , the patient's blood pressures were in the 200 to
300s and at times even higher. Over the week prior to admission ,
it was noted that the patient gained somewhere from about 8 to 10
pounds with increasing abdominal girth and lower extremity edema.
As noted above , the patient's fingersticks were noted to be
elevated in the 300s and so her Lantus was titrated from 90 units
daily to 100 units by the visiting nurse. The patient was
previously discharged on Lasix 40 mg twice daily , which was
titrated up to 80 mg twice daily also by the visiting nurse and
her primary care physician. The patient had no additional
shortness of breath , and her oxygen sat was unchanged on her home
dose of O2. She had no chest pain , no cough , and no fevers. No
nausea , vomiting , or diarrhea. The patient had finished a 7-day
course of cefpodoxime on the day of admission. The patient's
mental status was unchanged as felt by the daughter.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , on 3 L home O2.
2. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
3. Cryptogenic cirrhosis complicated by ascites and esophageal

ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with her daughter , Lescano , who
is her healthcare proxy and can be reached at 976-115-0167. The
patient has never drunk alcohol , smoked , and never used any
illicit drugs. The patient is originally from Clear A Rieholl and
Spanish-speaking.
FAMILY HISTORY: Unremarkable.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
VITAL SIGNS: The patient was afebrile. Temperature was 96.9 ,
heart rate was 62 , and blood pressure was 90/50. She was
breathing 16 times and was saturating 99% on her home baseline
dose of oxygen at 3 L.
HEENT: Notable for tongue that showed thrush.
NECK: JVP was difficult to asses but thought to be slightly
elevated. There was no lymphadenopathy.
LUNGS: Dry inspiratory crackles at both bases.
CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient has slow heart rate with normal S1
and S2. No murmurs , rubs , or gallops.
ABDOMEN: Slightly distended , soft , and nontender with no
guarding and positive bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES: Remarkable for 3+ edema , pitted , to the knees.
NEUROLOGIC: No asterixis and no focal deficits.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Electrolytes were remarkable for
BUN and creatinine of 65/1.6 as well as a potassium of 6.0.
Albumin was noted to be 2.6. CBC showed a white count of 8.51 ,
hematocrit of 34.7 , and platelets of 92 with less than 5% bands.
STUDIES: EKG reveals sinus bradycardia at 50 beats per minute
with normal axis and normal intervals and nonspecific ST
abnormalities , unchanged from prior EKGs. A chest x-ray showed
unchanged coarse bilateral opacities with no acute process.
IMPRESSION: The patient is a 76-year-old female with history of
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and cryptogenic cirrhosis
complicated by ascites and esophageal varices , who was admitted
with hyperglycemia and volume overload.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Endocrine: The patient was admitted with hyperglycemia and
sugar in the 600s. The patient was initially started on insulin
drip at 4 units per hour , and her sugars quickly normalized. The
patient was transitioned over to subcutaneous insulin regimen
that included Lantus and q.a.c. aspartate as well as sliding
scale. The patient's fingersticks remained labile throughout
this admission and at times were elevated in the 300s and other
times were normal in the range of 70 to 90. The patient's
insulin was titrated , and she was discharged on a regimen that
included Lantus 90 units subcutaneously daily as well as
aspartate 28 units subcutaneously before each meal. It was
noticed that the patient had the most difficulty with
postprandial sugars often after lunch and dinner. Therefore , we
recommended that if she continues to have hyperglycemia , that it
would be best to titrate the q.a.c. aspartate. It would be best
to avoid titrating the Lantus too much given that her fasting
sugar in the morning was often normal. The patient had no
hypoglycemic episodes during this admission. Of note , the
patient was not previously on q.a.c. insulin dosing at home;
however , following discharge from rehabilitation , it was thought
that this would not likely be the best regimen for her. This was
discussed with the patient's family and caregivers who were
amenable to this idea , however , will likely need further
teaching.
2. GI: The patient has a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis
complicated by ascites and esophageal varices. The patient was
thought to be grossly volume overloaded due to her cirrhosis and
hypoalbuminemia on admission. The patient was initially diuresed
with IV Lasix with good results. The patient did have a bump in
her creatinine due to this aggressive diuresis and her Lasix was
held for several days , but her oral Lasix was restarted prior to
discharge. The patient was discharged on 60 mg of p.o. Lasix
twice daily. The patient on admission was thought to have
significant amount of ascites based on abdominal exam. The
patient had recently completed a course of treatment for
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and had no abdominal tenderness
but did have distention. An abdominal ultrasound was obtained as
a diagnostic paracentesis was considered given that the patient
had an episode of confusion; however , abdominal ultrasound
revealed only a small lot of ascites that was not amenable to
paracentesis. The patient has a history of esophageal varices
and was continued on her nadolol for prophylaxis. The patient
was continued on her Bactrim for SBP prophylaxis. The patient
did have an episode of confusion and delirium during this
admission , which was felt to be likely due to hepatic
encephalopathy. The patient's delirium improved with the
initiation of lactulose. The patient was discharged on lactulose
30 mL q.i.d. , which we titrated so that the patient has at least
3 bowel movements daily. At the time of discharge , the patient
was alert and oriented. Of note , the patient was not started on
Aldactone for management of her volume overload given that she
was admitted with hyperkalemia and has a history of elevated
potassium.
3. Neurologic: The patient had had one episode of delirium
during this admission where she was confused , did not know where
she was , and was not interacting with her family appropriately.
The patient had a workup at that time , which included an
infectious workup , which revealed no evidence of infection. The
patient was started on lactulose , which had to be an administered
initially by retention enema as she was refusing to take p.o.
The patient's mental status improved within 24 hours of starting
the lactulose , and she was continued on this regimen and will be
discharged on it. Of note , the patient had no asterixis on
discharge.
4. Renal: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease
with a baseline creatinine of 1.3 to 1.7. The patient was
admitted with a creatinine of 1.6 , which did increase slightly
with increased diuresis. The patient's Lasix was held for a day
or two and then she was restarted on her oral home Lasix regimen ,
which was titrated to 60 mg p.o. b.i.d. Of note , the patient's
lisinopril was held on admission due to hyperkalemia. The
lisinopril was not restarted prior to discharge given the
patient's history of hyperkalemia and several episodes during
this admission , which required the administration of Kayexalate.
The patient likely should be on an ACE inhibitor for chronic
kidney disease , but this can be re-added as an outpatient with
very close monitoring of her potassium as this was felt to be
indicated by the patient's primary care physician. Of note , the
patient was normotensive off lisinopril during this admission.
5. Pulmonary: The patient has history of IPF and had no acute
pulmonary issues during this admission. The patient was
saturating well on her home dose of O2 throughout the entire
admission. The patient was continued on her home dose of
dexamethasone for IPF.
6. Infectious Disease: Prior to discharge , the patient was
incidentally noted to have a urine culture that was growing
greater than 100 , 000 colonies. The patient was afebrile and had
no symptoms of dysuria but did have a mildly elevated white count
of 11 , 000. Based on the patient's recent UTI , she was started on
cefpodoxime for a short 5-day course. Results of this urine
culture will need to be followed up and her antibiotics adjusted
as necessary. The patient was continued on her Bactrim for both
SPEP and PCP prophylaxis.
CODE STATUS: The patient was full code throughout this entire admission.
PHYSICAL EXAM AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE: The patient home was
afebrile and normotensive with the heart rate in the 60s to 70s
and was saturating in the high 90s on her baseline 3 L of O2 via
nasal cannula. Her weight at the time of discharge was 198
pounds. Her cardiac exam was normal. Her lungs had fine
crackles at both bases. Her abdomen was obese with no fluid
wave. Her extremities had bilateral pitting edema to the knees
and she had no asterixis.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Cefpodoxime 200 mg p.o. daily times 5 days , this medication
should be discontinued after the last dose on 10/1/07 .
2. Fosamax 35 mg p.o. weekly.

daily.
16. Nadolol 10 mg p.o. q.24h.
17. Prilosec 20 mg p.o. daily.
18. Bactrim 1 tablet p.o. q.24h.
FOLLOW-UP:
1. The patient was discharged on 60 mg of Lasix twice daily.
The patient's weight at the time of discharge was 198 kg. The
patient should be weighed daily , and her primary care physician
should be contacted for any weight gain greater than 5 pounds.
The patient should have a chem-7 checked within the next 2 to 3
days to follow her creatinine as well as her potassium.
2. The patient had a urine culture sent prior to discharge that
revealed 100 , 000 colonies of bacteria that were not yet
identified at the time of discharge. The patient was then
started empirically on cefpodoxime based on past microbiologic
data. The results of this urine culture should be followed up in
a day or two and her antibiotics can be adjusted as necessary.
