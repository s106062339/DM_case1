HOSPITAL COURSE:
In summary , this is a 48-year-old man with a history of bipolar disorder ,
seizure disorder presenting with supratherapeutic INR and signs of
urinary retention.
Genitourinary: Given his prostate exam and history of BPH it was
thought that his urinary retention was due to a large prostate
complicated by taking opiates for his right leg pain and
potentially also contributing from his psychiatric medications.
He did well with a voiding trial after starting Flomax and he has
not had a Foley in since hospital day #2.
Right lower extremity pain: He had a negative noninvasive lower
extremity ultrasound with no cords palpated. He had prior a
orthopaedic workup that was negative. He is receiving oxycodone.
There has been some thought that maybe his hypomagnesemia is
exacerbating his pain possibly in the form of leg cramps. He is
being repleted with mag with increasing doses of standing
magnesium. However , exam is most consistent with underlying diabetic
neuropathy and he was started on Neurontin 300 qhs , which will need to be
titrated as outpatient.
Diabetes: He is a diabetic on oral agents. His oral medications
were held while in house and he was given NPH and sliding scale. Oral
medications were reinstituted for the last 5 days of his hospitalization.
Anticoagulation: He has history of antiphospholipid antibody
with history of stroke from mitral clot. He was supratherapeutic
on his Coumadin , upon arrival he was reversed with vitamin K and
is now subtherapeutic being bridged with Lovenox until his
Coumadin is at least 2. His Coumadin should be titrated
according to INRs that are checked every other day until for a
goal of INR 2-3.
Psychiatric: For his bipolar disorder and seizure disorder , he
was continued on his home meds.
Neurological: He had a brief episode of delirium over the
weekend which was likely thought to be metabolic and has now
resolved. He is at his baseline. He should avoid opiates when
possible.
Disposition: He was discharged to home on new medications which
include increased magnesium , flomax , neurontin. He should
continue his antibiotics for his sinusitis history , to be finished on 5/15/06.
