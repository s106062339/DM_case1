This is a 54 yo man with ESRD+MMP who was admitted for one episode of
spontaneous bleeding from his AVF. PMH sig for brittle DMI , HTN , ESRD
on HD , s/p NSTEMI 2003 , alcoholic CMP , severe PVD , long QTc syndrome ( s/p
recent torsades ). pt also c/o pleuritic CP , with subtle TW changes.
1 ) CV: Rhythm: recent torsades , on tele , no events. Repleted lytes prn.
Pump: Echo showed EF 55% , severe LVH. continue HTN meds as outpt ,
including lisinopril , norvasc , and hydralazine , nitrite. Ischemia: subtle
EKG changes but no repeat CP since admission. cardiac enzymes negative , EKG
changes resolved somewhat by end of admission. cont ASA , BB , statin , and
restart plavix as pt's hct was stable on discharge ( 34.6 ). pt had been
hemodynamically stable throughout hospitalization.
-pt has f/u appt with cardiology Dr Mitchel Lindquist 9/30/5 at 4pm ,
051-469-9935 , As Tonrham Eeli Memorial Hospital , Ga Bilegarl Proo
2 ) RENAL: ESRD on HD MWF , last 6/22/05. Fistula patent and working well
per renal team. resume outpt HD schedule MWF.
3 ) HEME: Pt with fistula bleed , likely compounded by plavix use. Hct at
30% ( low end of baseline ). Bleed stopped after prolonged pressure. HD
without difficulty in AM 4/6/05 , but because pt had a 6 unit drop ( from
30 to 24 ) , pt was kept for observation and was transfused 1 unit of PRBCs.
pt received an additional unit of PRBCs 2/22/05. pt was dicharged back to
rehab with no further bleeding on PM of 7/23/05.
4 ) GI: pt had episodes of guaiac+ stool on and off during this
hospitalization , but never frank melena or BRBPR. the GI consult was
informally consulted and felt that as long as pt was hemodynamically
stable , this was not an inpatient issue to urgently pursue at this time.
pt's Hct on discharge ( 34.6 ) was around his baseline. the renal team agreed
with GI's assessment.
-pt has outpt GI appt on 6/20/05 at 10AM with Dr Picozzi ( 059-631-4196 )
4 ) PULM: No active issues.
5 ) NEURO: Sz d/o on Keppra. Mental status improved compared to prior
admission description. A&O x 3 , responds appropriately to questions.
6 ) ID: sore throat with ? esophagitis , nystatin S&S.
7 ) ENDO: DM with hypo/hyperglycemic episodes in past. Prev followed by
endocrine for labile sugars. On home lantus + 3 units qAC + SS novolog.
increased home lantus dose to 15u qHS but am sugar 26 on 8/28 , and low
sugars again on AM 2/30/05 , so will send out on lantus 6 qhs and should
closely monitor bs and titrate lantus/novolog SS qAC appropriately. pt will
most likely require a bedtime snack to avoid his early morning hypoglycemic
episodes.

CODE: FULL
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: please follow up with the diabetes clinic and the cardiology clinic , both
appointments on monday 6/22/05. come back to the ED if the fistula starts
to bleed again.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Satisfactory
TO DO/PLAN:
follow serial Hcts. monitor AVF for future bleeds. please closely monitor
pt's sugar levels--he needs a bedtime snack to avoid bottoming out in the
early mornings. pt has f/u appointments for cardiology , diabetes , and
GI--please make sure that he makes it or they will most likely drop him
from their pt lists ( 2/2 multiple no-shows ). thanks.
