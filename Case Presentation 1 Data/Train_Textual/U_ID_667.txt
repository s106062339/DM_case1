Discharge Date: 3/10/2006
ATTENDING: GLANDEN , MODESTO HAL MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Chronic peripheral vascular disease
complicated by atheroemboli , status post cardiac catheterization.
PROCEDURES:
1. 6/28/2006 , aortogram bilateral lower extremity runoff Dr.
Zumstein
2. 9/22/2006 left femoral to dorsalis pedis bypass graft , Dr.
Saltzberg
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 75-year-old former smoker
with hypertension , diabetes , end-stage renal disease on
hemodialysis , CAD status post coronary catheterization in October
2006 and October 2006 who presented in clinic with progressively
worsening bilateral foot pain , foot mottling and new ulcerations.
Concern for atheroembolization was raised following cardiac
catheterization. In followup , the patient appeared to have
persistent ulcerations as well as erythema. Pedal signals by
Doppler , however , were present. She was admitted from clinic for
cellulitis and further evaluation of her vascular anatomy. At
the time of admission , she denied chest pain , shortness of breath
or fever , chills. She described the pain as burning in both her
feet with some relief obtained when dangling the feet off the
bed.

SOCIAL HISTORY:
1. Tobacco , 80-pack-year history , quit in 1990.
2. No alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Notable for temperature of
99.2 , heart rate of 121 in sinus tachycardia , blood pressure
116/60 , saturating 98% on room air. She was noted to have a 2/6
systolic murmur at the apex. Lungs were clear bilaterally.
Pulse exam showed no palpable femoral pulses and biphasic
dopplerable pulses bilaterally , DP and PT. Extremities showed
bilateral mottling of all toes and an open 0.5 cm ulceration at
the base of the left fourth toe. All toes are exquisitely tender
to palpation. Sensation is decreased but equal bilaterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This 75-year-old female vasculopath was
admitted for further evaluation of her peripheral vascular
disease which was suspected to be contributing to her new
ulcerations and progressively worsening wrist pain as an
exacerbating factor to likely atheroembolic phenomenon , status
post coronary catheterizations earlier in the year. She was
placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics and plan was made for an MRA
to evaluate her anatomy. Unfortunately , the patient was unable
to tolerate the MR and did experience some mental status changes
that prevented further noninvasive imaging , when she received
some narcotic following her hemodialysis round. Over the ensuing
days she required rather significant doses of Zyprexa and Haldol
to contain agitation and delirium , as the patient would also get
physical and violent. This appeared to sedate her sufficiently
and over the following days , she did manage to calm significantly
and returned to her baseline mental status. She did appear very
emotionally labile throughout the rest of her stay and incredibly
remorseful for previous events. On 6/28/2006 , she was offered
an angiogram to delineate aortic and bilateral lower extremity
runoff anatomy. She did tolerate this well under simple IV
conscious sedation. This showed chronic disease with
collateralization and very poor inflow to the bilateral feet with
essentially one vessel run off on either side. After extensive
discussions with the patient and the patient's family , the
patient did agree to a left femoral to dorsalis pedis bypass
graft which was performed on 9/22/2006 without complication.
Please see the operative note for further details. The patient
did tolerate the procedure well. By time of discharge , she was
tolerating a regular diet and ambulating at baseline with her
rolling walker. The pain was well controlled with minimal
analgesics that were not narcotic based. Cardiology was
consulted during this time to optimize her prior to the OR. Her
primary cardiologist , Dr. Fugle did make some recommendations
including an echocardiogram that showed preserved ejection
fraction and no wall motion abnormalities. Her beta blockade was
titrated up and she was instructed to follow up with cardiology.
She did tolerate hemodialysis throughout this time without undue
difficulty. She did on one occasion experience dyspnea following
hemodialysis that resolved of its own accord , no cardiac events
or in evidence by EKG or by following cardiac enzymes. As the
patient was in stable condition and back to her baseline level of
activity with very strong support at home , she was discharged to
home with services for wound checks and home safety evaluation.
She was instructed to follow up with Dr. Sedlachek in one to two
weeks.
