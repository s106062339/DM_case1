HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: She is a 66-year-old female with
severe diabetes mellitus type II , autoimmune hemolytic anemia ,
peripheral vascular disease , COPD , asthma , and history of
multiple infections who presents with bilateral lower extremity
area edema , swelling , and pain. She specifically complained of
increasing erythema , swelling , and pain of the right second toe
and left foot x 1 day. She saw her podiatrist on the morning of
admission , 7/6/2003 , and her right toe was drained at that
time , yielding pus. Cultures were drawn and it was noted that
she was have increasing erythema over the right ankle and the
left foot all the way to the shin. She had no fever but did have
chills , no shortness of breath or cough , wheezing , no dizziness
or orthostatic symptoms. She had recently been admitted between
8/7/2003 and 3/2/2003 for a COPD flare , pneumonia , and
anemia. She is known to hemolyze additionally in the setting of
infection. At that time she was treated on steroids and at the
time of this admission , was on a prednisone taper. During that
prior admission , she had also being treated with levofloxacin ,
was transfused 4 units of packed red blood cells , and was also
being treated with Aramis. She had had an abdominal CT during
that admission for left upper quadrant pain , which demonstrated
no evidence of splenic infarct. In the ED on this admission , she
was afebrile , her vital signs were stable , she was started on
levofloxacin , and she had plain films of her right foot , which
were consistent with evidence of chronic versus acute
osteomyelitis of the second toe.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: On review of systems , she denied any chest
pain , urinary symptoms , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , and her
fingerstick , she mentioned , had been running high , to the 250s on
prednisone. She has a left plantar ulcer as well , which she had
planned on having surgery soon for.
ALLERGIES: To Keflex , Ultram , Vancomycin , and Linezolid. With
Linezolid , she gets headaches and hypertension , with Vancomycin
hives , Ultram produces systemic reaction of unclear nature , and
to Keflex her allergy is questionable because she has tolerated
cephalosporins and penicillins in the past by report of the
admitting team.
FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for colon cancer and esophageal cancer
in her father and mother respectively.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She is a former nurse at Forestnew Medical Center She is married and has one daughter. She has a
35-pack year history of smoking but she quit in 1994. No alcohol
use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Notable for an elevated blood pressure of
150/70 , stable heart rate of 70 , afebrile , saturating 100% on
room air , breathing at 18. Other notable aspects of her physical
examination: Chest: She had a left carotid bruit. Her chest
was clear to auscultation bilaterally with the exception of mild
diffuse inspiratory wheezes. Cardiac: She had a regular rate ,
distant heart sounds on her cardiac examination but no murmurs ,
rubs , or gallops. Abdomen: Benign. Back: No CVA tenderness in
her extremities. Extremities: She had tense edema , left greater
than right. She also had an ulcer on the plantar surface of the
left extremity , which was not fluctuant but did have
serosanguinous drainage and erythema that was circumferential to
the mid-shin. There was more tenderness over the lateral
malleolus. She also had some left calf tenderness with a
questionable palpable cord. In her right lower extremity , she
had erythema over the right second toe with a punctate lesion
draining serosanguinous fluid. Discontinuous erythema over the
interior shin was also noted. She had diffuse onychomycosis and
right intradigital ulceration between the 4th and 5th toe. There
was not right calf tenderness that was noted. Neurological:
Neurological was grossly intact and there were no focal deficits
noted.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Infectious Disease: Her blood cultures were positive for
gram-positive cocci , which was resistant to methicillin ,
clindamycin , and levofloxacin. She had an MRI of the lower
extremities bilaterally , which demonstrated no collections but
was notable for acute osteomyelitis of the left 2nd and 3rd
metatarsal as well as chronic osteitis of the calcaneous wounds.
The right phalanges were not visualized well. She was started on
Levaquin initially but this was discontinued when the
sensitivities came back and instead she was started on
dopthromycin. Infectious Disease was consulted at this time and
the antibiotics were changed to Bactrim IV and then to p.o.
Bactrim secondary to an increase in her creatinine. A TTE on
2/21/2003 was negative for any vegetation. She underwent
debridement on 10/19/2003 in the afternoon. The material was
sent for culture. She also complained of sternal discomfort ,
dysphasia , and oral thrush on examination , and it was felt that
she likely had oral candidiasis secondary to her steroid course
and so she was started on Diflucan as well as on a nystatin swish
and swallow. The cultures from her bone tissue were positive
methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus as well as
beta-hemolytic streptococcus. Infectious Disease once again felt
that , given her allergies , that p.o. Bactrim would be the best
way to treat these pathogens. On 3/19/2003 , the Diflucan was
discontinued and she was continued on nystatin swish and swallow
for the oral candidiasis , which has since been improving. She is
also being continued on Bactrim and her creatinine has stabilized
at 1.9 after peaking at 2.2. She has follow ups scheduled with
the Infectious Disease physicians on 1/27/2004 and will be
continuing her Bactrim for a full 6-week course with weekly CBC
checks , which will be monitored by her primary care physician ,
Dr. Sherman Handel
2. Heme: The patient has a history of autoimmune hemolytic
anemia. Her hematologist of record is Dr. Bocanegra On her
last admission , she required transfusions and was thought to have
hemolyzed in the setting of her pneumonia although her hemolysis
labs at that time were negative. On this admission , her LDH and
bilirubins were normal , her hematocrit steadily decreased from
38.8 to 27 and then increased. She had an increase in her LDH
but no schistocytes were notable on smear. Nevertheless , she was
thought to be hemolyzing and received a total of 6 units of
packed red blood cells , given in doses of 2 units each over the
course of this hospitalization. She was transfused successfully
without any complications or transfusion reactions and her
hematocrit at the time of discharge is 36.0.
3. Pulmonary: The patient's prednisone taper was discontinued
on day 4 because of oral candidiasis. She was continued on nebs ,
however , for intermittent wheezing. She has had no acute COPD
exacerbations but has had increased shortness of breath
periodically , which has been improved with nebulizer treatments.
Chest x-ray on 1/7/2003 demonstrated a small bilateral
effusion. She was thought to be fluid overloaded at this time so
her Lasix was restarted for diuresis. Also of note , the patient
had pain in the left posterior lower lung field , which was
pleuritic in nature. She had LENIs done , which were negative ,
had a PE protocol CT on 1/7/2003 , which was negative. At that
time , she was diuresed and her pleuritic left lower lobe chest
pain resolved with diuresis. She had a recurrence of this pain 2
days prior to discharge after receiving 2 units of packed red
blood cells , which presumably led to a volume overload situation.
However , once again , after diuresis , she had complete resolution
of her symptoms. At this time , the CT scan was reviewed to
ensure that there was no fracture of the ribs as she did have
tenderness in the left lower lung field area. However , the ribs
were visualized well and there was no evidence of any fracture.
4. Cardiovascular: The patient was continued on Toprol and her
Diovan was held secondary to elevated potassium. She had
intermittent chest pain without EKG changes , possibly secondary
to esophageal spasm , which was relieved by nitroglycerine. Her
enzymes were negative for the first episode. Her troponin was
0.25 on random draw. This was likely a false positive and her
enzymes thereafter were negative. She had a preoperative MIBI on
10/11/2003 , which demonstrated a moderate area of reversible
ischemia in the territory of the right coronary artery. The
decision was made , however , to go ahead with the surgery for her
feet with spinal block , not with general anesthesia. Her Toprol
was increased to 75 mg q.d. given her MIBI findings. Her goal
heart rate was set for the 60s and a low-dose statin was also
added to her regimen. It was felt that the cardiovascular plan
in terms of her coronary artery disease should be to increase her
exercise tolerance during rehab to the point where she may begin
to experience symptoms and then cap at that time can be
considered. Towards the end of the patient's hospitalization ,
she required diuresis , particularly after receiving boluses of
volume with her blood transfusions. It was noted that , when her
volume status went up , she had an increase in swelling of her
lower extremities bilaterally as well as recurrences of her
left-sided back pain in the area of the left lower lung field.
However , as noted before , these improved with diuresis.
5. Renal: Her baseline creatinine is 1.3 to 1.4 , increased on
this admission likely due secondary to the dye load , which she
received prior to scans. Her creatinine peaked at 2.7 with the
IV Bactrim but began to trend down after the IV Bactrim was
discontinued. Other reasons for which her creatinine likely
increased during this admission were secondary to her
dopthromycin and also secondary to the IV Bactrim.
6. Endocrine: The patient's blood sugars have been well
controlled after her prednisone was discontinued and she was
maintained on a regimen of NPH.
7. Ophthalmology: The Ophthalmology team was consulted for a
new left floater. The patient has a history of vitreous
hemorrhages and questionable retinal detachment in the past. The
optic examination was notable for vitreous bleed. In response to
this , the head of the patient's bed was elevated and her symptoms
were stable thereafter. If she has a recurrence of curtains
symptoms or spots or flashes , it is recommended that
Ophthalmology be reconsulted at that time.
8. GI: The patient had complained of right upper quadrant pain
during this admission. Her liver function tests were elevated
when initially checked. It was recommended by Infectious Disease
since these would be monitored with IV Bactrim. They have been
trending down since she is status post cholecystectomy and was
initially very tender in her right upper quadrant. Her right
upper quadrant ultrasound on 10/19/2003 was negative except for
an enlarged liver alkaline phosphatase that was thought to be
secondary to osteomyelitis. Her right upper quadrant pain
improved subsequently during this hospital course with continued
diuresis and antibiotic treatment.
