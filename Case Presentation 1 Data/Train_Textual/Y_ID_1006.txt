Discharge Date: 10/17/1997
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 76 year old woman with
asthma. Presenting problem was
shortness of breath. Problem list included anxiety , status post
cholecystectomy in 1988 , headaches , asthma , hypertension , vertigo ,
question of pneumonia in February 1996. Patient's cardiac risk
factors included a history of hypertension , she had no known
history of elevated cholesterol , she did not smoke , and had no
history of diabetes or family history of cardiac disease. She had
no prior myocardial infarction and no history of angina. The
patient did have a history of asthma with no prior hospitalizations
or steroid tapers. She did take p.o. Proventil at night and there
were no pulmonary function tests available on record. Two days
prior to admission , the patient noted sudden onset of inability to
sleep secondary to shortness of breath when lying down. The
patient tried her inhaler without relief of symptoms. She also
noted an intermittent nonproductive cough. The patient denied
fevers or chills. She reported that her symptoms did not improve
during the day and the night prior to admission , the patient noted
shortness of breath on exertion. She denied chest pain or chest
pressure. She had no diaphoresis , nausea , vomiting , or light
headedness. The patient presented to Bellmarle Medical Center
Emergency Department for persistent inability to sleep. On
evaluation in the Emergency Room , her blood pressure was 136/75
with a pulse of 124 , respiratory rate of 32 , and saturations of 94%
on room air. She was given nebulizers times three then 20 mg of
intravenous Lasix. She put out 600 cc of urine to that Lasix. The
Emergency Department then attempted to give her Verapamil 5 mg
times three to decrease her heart rate which was not effective.
The patient had no prior history of cardiac event. Her last
exercise test was in 1993. She went three minutes and five seconds
on the treadmill and stopped secondary to shortness of breath. Her
maximum heart rate was 130 with a maximum blood pressure of 190/80.
She had a baseline left bundle-branch block and therefore , her EKG
were not interpretable.
ALLERGIES: Patient had no known drug allergies.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Meclizine 25 mg t.i.d. , Proventil tablet 4 mg
p.o. q.h.s. , oxazepam 10 mg p.o. q.8h. ,
hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.d. , and Flexeril 10 mg p.o. q.8h.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Habits included that patient did not drink alcohol
and she did not smoke cigarettes. Patient lived
at home with her family who were very involved with her care.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Patient was an elderly Hispanic woman in no
acute distress. Vital signs included a
temperature of 98.2 , blood pressure 108/59 , pulse 101 , and
respiratory rates of 30 with saturations of 92% on three liters.
HEENT: Examination revealed a jugular venous pressure at 6 cm.
CHEST: Showed bilateral rales two thirds of the way up without
wheezes and no focal findings or egophony. CARDIAC: Examination
showed a regular rate and rhythm , tachycardic with a normal S1 and
S2 , no murmurs , and no S3 or S4. ABDOMEN: Showed a well healed
surgical scar , breath sounds present , no hepatosplenomegaly , and no
hepatojugular reflux. EXTREMITIES: Without edema , clubbing , or
cyanosis and she had 2+ symmetrical distal pulses. NEUROLOGICAL:
Examination was within normal limits.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: SMA 7 was within normal limits with a BUN
of 15 and a creatinine of 1.0 , CBC showed
a white count of 9.45 , hematocrit of 36.5 , and platelets of 338.
CK was 110 and troponin was 0.0. Chest x-ray showed increased
heart size with bilateral increased interstitial markings
consistent with pulmonary edema and positive pulmonary vascular
redistribution. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 106 beats per
minute with normal intervals , an axis of negative 16 , a left
bundle-branch block , and no significant changes since 5/6/97.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted for new onset congestive
heart failure. She was ruled out for myocardial
infarction. On the second day of hospitalization , she underwent an
exercise tolerance test MIBI on which she went four minutes and
eleven seconds on a modified Bruce protocol. She stopped secondary
to fatigue. She denied chest pain , there were no EKG changes , and
she had several bursts of nonsustained supraventricular tachycardia
with exercise. Nuclear images revealed mild fixed reduced uptake
in the inferior wall consistent with a small injury but no evidence
of ongoing ischemia. An echocardiogram was also performed that
revealed a dilated left ventricle with global hypokinesis and an
ejection fraction of 15% to 20%. She had mild mitral calcification
with mild regurgitation , trace tricuspid regurgitation , and a
normal right ventricular size and function. It was determined that
the patient would benefit from afterload reduction and inatropy
given her poor ejection fraction. She was started on Captopril ,
Digoxin , and Isordil in addition to the Lasix she had received upon
presentation for her congestive heart failure. The patient
tolerated these medications well and maintained a systolic blood
pressure of approximately 100 without symptoms of orthostasis.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Proventil tablets 4 mg p.o.
q.h.s. , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Flexeril 10 mg p.o. q.8h. , Digoxin 0.0625 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 80 mg
p.o. q.d. , Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , meclizine 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
nitroglycerin 1/150 tablets taking one sublingually q.5 minutes
times three p.r.n. chest pain , Serax 10 mg p.o. q.8h. , K-Dur 20 mEq
p.o. q.d. , and Lisinopril 7.5 mg p.o. q.d.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow-up with her primary care
physician , Dr. Rheaves , at Sharp Statepark Rehab in
Ston Dr. Jankoff will adjust her medications as
necessary and will arrange for an out-patient Holter monitor to
follow-up with nonsustained run of supraventricular tachycardia
during her exercise stress test.
