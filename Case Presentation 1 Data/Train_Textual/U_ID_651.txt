Discharge Date: 10/5/2006
ATTENDING: DUNDERMAN , JAYSON M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Aortic valve stenosis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 75-year-old gentleman with a
history of coronary artery disease who is status post CABG in
1983 who has recently experienced unstable angina and was
admitted in April of 2006 to Omill Mang Medical Center Of for
workup and was found to have an aortic valve area of 0.8 and
significant vein graft disease to OM1. The patient received
coronary stents to OM1 and the native circumflex at Palclean Center in April of 2006. Of note , the right coronary artery was
seen to be occluded at that time as was the vein graft to that
coronary. The vein graft to the LAD had been priorly stented and
was noted to be patent. The patient began developing shortness
of breath and symptoms of aortic stenosis , which were complicated
by anemia , which was thought to have developed due to some AV
malformations of the foregut. In view of the patient's
progressive symptoms , it was decided to proceed with aortic valve
replacement , which was first scheduled for September , but then
rescheduled when the patient was noted to have coughing and
hemoptysis. The patient was treated for pneumonia surgery
rescheduled and he is admitted to Ingfrisdam Rywilf Health
for reoperation aortic valve replacement.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , gout ,
GERD , congestive heart failure , anemia and BPH.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Prostate surgery , left hip replacement ,
right total knee replacement , cholecystectomy and tonsillectomy.
FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for coronary artery disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY: A 60-pack-year smoking history , two glasses of
wine every evening. The patient is a widower , lives alone , four
children live in the area.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1. Atenolol 50 mg p.o. daily.
2. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily.
3. Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily.
4. Atorvastatin 80 mg p.o. daily.
5. Allopurinol 300 mg p.o. daily.
6. Protonix 40 mg p.o. daily.
7. Multivitamin.
8. Iron daily.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 5 feet 6 inches tall , 82 kg , temperature
96 , heart rate 70 , blood pressure 124/60 and oxygen saturation is
100% on room air. HEENT , PERRLA. Oropharynx benign. Neck
without carotid bruits. Chest with a midline sternotomy.
Cardiovascular , regular rate and rhythm , systolic ejection
murmur. Respiratory , breath sounds clear bilaterally. Abdomen ,
cholecystectomy scar well-healed , soft , no masses. Extremities
without scarring , varicosities or edema , 2+ pedal and radial
pulses bilaterally. Allen's test in both upper extremities
normal by pulse oximeter. Neuro , alert and oriented , grossly
nonfocal exam.
LABORATORY DATA: Preop laboratory chemistries include BUN of 21
and creatinine of 0.8. White blood cell count is 5.8 , hematocrit
35 and INR is 1.0. Carotid imaging , left internal carotid artery
1 to 25% occluded , right internal carotid artery 25% to 49%
occluded. Cardiac catheterization data from 2/29/06 performed
at outside hospital reveals the following: 60% left main , 100%
RCA , 100% mid LAD , 100% SVG1 to LAD , 100% SVG3 to circumflex.
There is borderline LV function. Estimated ejection fraction is
35%. There is inferior hypokinesia , global hypokinesia , vein
graft occlusion of 100% to the right coronary artery , widely
patent saphenous graft , inside of prior standing to OM1 and OM2 ,
widely patent saphenous vein graft to the LAD , patent prior
stents placed in native LAD and left main. Echo from 2/29/06
estimates ejection fraction of 55% , finds aortic valve stenosis
with mean gradient of 53 mmHg and a peak gradient of 82 mmHg and
calculated valve area of 0.8 cm2 , mild aortic valve
insufficiency , mild mitral insufficiency , mild tricuspid
insufficiency , aortic valve was thickened with diminished cusp
mobility. The left atrium is enlarged. There is mitral annular
calcification , normal mitral leaflet excursion. Left ventricle
demonstrates concentric hypertrophy. There is normal right
systolic function. Right atrium is dilated. Right ventricle is
normal. Tricuspid valve was normal. There is severe aortic
valve stenosis. EKG , normal sinus rhythm at 68 with ST
elevations in V1 and V2 , inverted Ts in leads 1 , 2 , AVF , AVR , AVL
and V1 through V6. Chest x-ray is normal , but reveals aortic
calcification.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating room on
4/29/06 and underwent reoperation minimally invasive aortic
valve replacement with a 21-mm Carpentier-Edwards Magna valve.
The patient was taken to the Intensive Care Unit following
surgery on Levophed and epinephrine drips. He was noted to be
hypotensive following surgery , which was refractory to pressors
and volume requiring pressor boluses and transient application of
chest compressions and the patient underwent placement of an
intraaortic balloon pump. The balloon pump was weaned and
removed by postoperative day 2 and pressors were weaned by
postoperative day 3. The patient transferred to the Step-Down
Unit later on postoperative day #3 and continued to progress
daily. His diet was advanced to full house diet and was well
tolerated. The patient was started on beta-blockade , aspirin and
statin for his coronary artery disease and a course of
antibiotics was completed for a preoperative urinary tract
infection The patient was followed perioperatively by the
Diabetes Management Service for tight glycemic control. The
patient was weaned off of supplemental oxygen with ongoing
diuresis and he remained in sinus rhythm and saturated well on
room air for the remainder of his stay. The patient's
preoperative Flomax was restarted following the removal of Foley
catheter. The patient initially had difficulty voiding and then
voided without difficulty. He has been instructed to follow up
with his home neurologist within the next few weeks and earlier
if he has difficulties. The remainder of his postoperative stay
was uncomplicated and he is discharged to Rehab in good condition
on postoperative day #6.
At time of discharge , laboratory chemistries include the
following , sodium of 135 , potassium of 4.3 , BUN of 18 and
creatinine of 0.8. White blood cell count is 5.7 , hematocrit
27.5 and INR is 1.1.
He is discharged to Rehab on the following medications.
1. Flomax 0.4 mg p.o. daily.
2. Oxycodone 5 to 10 mg p.o. q.6 h. p.r.n. pain.
3. Niferex 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Toprol-XL 50 mg p.o. daily.
5. Allopurinol 300 mg p.o. daily.
6. Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily.
7. Atorvastatin 80 mg p.o. daily.
8. Colace 100 mg p.o. q.8 h. p.r.n. constipation.
9. Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily.
10. Potassium slow release 20 mEq p.o. daily.
11. Glucophage-XR 500 mg p.o. q.8 h.
12. NovoLog sliding scale q.a.c. as needed.
The patient will follow up appointments with his cardiologist ,
Dr. Zuelke in one to two weeks and with his cardiac surgeon , Dr.
Vig in four to six weeks. He will also follow up with his
urologist , Dr. Dalby in three to four weeks.
