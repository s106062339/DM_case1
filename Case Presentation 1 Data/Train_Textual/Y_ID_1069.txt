BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: syncope
DDx: arrythmia vs obstructive sleep apnea vs vasovagal episode
HPI: This is a 55yo F with h/o ESRD , DM , HTN , morbid obesity , presents
with recurrent episodes of unresponsiveness at dialysis ( x2 ). On am of
admission , pt was unresponsive , CPR initiated , and pt had spontaneous
return of vital signs. Of note , an AED placed on her and determined pt
did not have shockable rhythm. AED unfortunately did not print any
strips , so we have no record of the incident. MD at Cord University Of Medical Center reports
pt was cyanotic , apenic , with no carotid or raidal pulses , and had no
heart sounds by cardiac auscultation. MD reports patient's skin color
improved significantly with initiation of adequate bag mask ventilation.
Whiel pt being moved from chair to ground , pt's HD access was lost. Pt
asymptomatic on transfer , and in ER.

STUDIES:
ECHO 7/23 showed LVEF 60-65% with mild concentric LVH
and no RWMA
ECHO 9/30/06 : nl LV size , nl LV functino , EF 55-60%
with no RWMA. enlarged RV , mild LAE , nl RA , trave MR< mild TR , no
change from prior study in 8/18
EKG: rhythm 100 beats per minute with no acute ST changes and old T-wave
inversion in V2.
----------
PET perfusion stress test 1/17/06 :Image quality was excellent. The images
demonstrated normal LV size and normal tracer uptake in the lungs. They
also demonstrated a mildly dilated RV with normal RV tracer uptake at
rest. There were no regional perfusion defects seen on the stress or
rest images. normal perfusion , LVEF 72% , moderate RVH
CXR 3/22/06 : PA and lateral films of the chest demonstrate right central
line at SVC. There are degenerative changes of the dorsal spine. The
heart is not enlarged. There are no acute infiltrates or effusions.
--------------
PROCEDURE: 10/7/06 : EP study revealed normal SA node functino , normal
conduction , and no tachyarrythmias were stimulated. An implanted loop
recorder device , the Medtronic Reveal Plus , was plced in patient's chest.
Pt tolerated procedure with no complications , bleeding or signs/sx of
infection.

ASSESSMENT AND HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM
55F with ESRD on HD ( 2/2 DM ) who had apparent syncopal episode while
at HD on 7/12 , which was similar in presentation to 4/11 episode from
recent admission.
1 ) CV: Whether or not pt actually ever a V-fib arrest seems to be in some
doubt , as she has never had an arrhythmia on tele. However , given this
is the second presentation , a proper arrhythmia evaluation was
warranted. The pt's differential included arrythmia vs obesity
hypoventilation ( pt reports OSA sx ) , hypoglycemia , and HD-related
hypotension. Ischemia ) serial cardiac enzymes negative. Pt was
continued on asa , bb , and placed on statin and NTG prn while ruling out
ischemic heart disease in anticipation of possible EP study. PET
perfusion scan for reversible ischemia was negative , showing normal
perfusion. Pump: JVP not appreciated , decreased LE edema relative to
prior admission. pt was continued home dose diuretic , and kept on a BB ,
CCB , and her ACEi to goal SBP<120. Rhythm: Pt was placed on telemetry to
monitor for arrythmia while on floor. No events were noted , but given
history , pt was taken to cath lab for EP study on 4/19/06. EPS showed
normal conduction , normal SA node , and so a loop recorder device was
implanted , which will monitor pt's HR and record if HR> or < parameters ,
or if pt triggers device to record. No signs/sx of bleeding , infectino ,
hematoma. Pt discharged on 3 day course of Keflex , to be given after HD.
RENAL: ESRD on HD. Pt HD on Wed and Sat am of admission , which she
tolerated with no difficulty. Pt was continued on EPO 10 , 000U qHD. Pt
has tunneled line in Right IJ for access.
HEME: Anemia: in setting of ESRD , baseline Hct around 30. Pt on
epogen. Anemia studies WNL.
ENDO: Diabetes type 2: Long and short-acting SC insulin. BID NPH
started at lower than home dose while oral diet is held , with lower
sliding scales , due to significant parts os stay where pt was NPO for
procedures. Wil lbe discharged on home insulin regimen.
ID: pt reports 4 day h/o productive cough prior to admission. Pt
afebrile , but on HD6 , pt has eleavtion in WBC ( 6.9-->12 ) , however
pt afebrile , asymptomatic , CXR shows no infiltrative process , and in
setting of recent procedure. Pt was placed on levofloxacin renally dosed.
DERM: Brawny skin changes: Lac Hydrin started. Candidiasis noted in folds
between pt's pannus and groin. 2% Miconazole topical poder started
PPX: PT received heparin SC , and Nexium , wil be discharged on protonix.
Code: Pt is Full Code. Health care proxy is Brain Bruess
325-446-2221
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You have been evaluated for your unresponsive episodes. We looked at
your heart and put a recorder in your chest to monitor for any irregular
heartbeats. Please follow up with your appointments , and return to the
hospital if you notice any chest pain , lightheadedness , or if you pass out
again. YOu have also been referred for an outpatient sleep study to
evaluate your obstructive sleep apnea. Please make an appointment with
them if they do not contact you.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1 ) We recommend pt get outpt polysomnography evaluation for OSA , and
potential fitting for CPAP. Referral placed , pt will receive call from
Torsba Dicli Errey Center 6- 754-443-2399 to make appointment for sleep study.
2 ) pt's home BP and insulin regimen unchanged.
3 ) ANtibiotics: continue pt's 3 day regimen of Keflex , in additino to 5
day regimen of Levofloxacin dosed renally for broader coverage.
4 ) started mild keratolytic Lac-Hydrin top BID for pt's brawny skin
changes.
5 ) short course miconazole 2% powder for pt's candidal nifectino in groin
skin folds
