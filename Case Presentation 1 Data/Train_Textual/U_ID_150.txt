Discharge Date: 1/17/2002
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 63 year-old male with a
history of peripheral vascular
disease , hypertension , non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ,
coronary artery disease , aortic stenosis , and status post bilateral
lower extremity bypass grafts who presented to the hospital with
increasing left lower extremity pain. He was taken to angiography
at which time tPA infusion was commenced. He is most recently
status post a left femoral to peroneal bypass graft in July of
2001 and has noticed that , in the past two to three weeks , has been
developing increasing rest pain and coolness to the left foot to
the point where he was not able to ambulate. In angiography , he
was found to have an occlusion of the left lower extremity vein
graft in the area of the mid-thigh with no passage of contrast and
minimal reconstitution of collaterals to his foot.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Peripheral vascular disease. Myocardial
infarction. Hypertension. Non-insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus. Aortic stenosis. He is status post a
left femoral to peroneal bypass graft in July of 2001. A revision
with cephalic vein to dorsalis pedis in July of 2001. He is
status post a right femoral to peroneal in September of 2000 and a right
fourth toe amputation in September of 2000.
MEDICATIONS: Glipizide 5 mg b.i.d. , Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg
q.d. , Lisinopril 20 mg q.d. , Simvastatin 20 mg q.d. ,
Amlodipine 5 mg q.d. , Imdur 30 mg q.d. , and Toprol 100 mg q.d. and
enteric coated aspirin.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient first underwent angiography at which
time they found that the vein graft was occluded.
He underwent tPA treatment and was brought back to angiography.
This time they did not find necessarily any improvement. The
conduit actually opened but it was found that he does have a high
grade anastomotic stricture of the distal anastomosis. He was
taken to the operating room on 10/23/01 for a left lower extremity
thrombectomy via groin and foot cutdown. Status post that
procedure he developed symptoms of acute chest pain and
hypotension. An ECG was performed , as well as troponin drawn ,
revealing that he has an acute myocardial infarction. The
cardiology service was called and the patient was admitted
post-thrombectomy to the cardiac care unit. At that time he was
managed medically for a few days. Based on his severe aortic
stenosis and difficulty in managing his blood pressure , the cardiac
surgery service was consulted. He was scheduled to see cardiac
surgery in office setting but , given his current condition , we were
going to perform his surgery a little bit sooner. He did have a
bout of pneumonia which mildly delayed his surgery.
On 1/18/02 he underwent catheterization which revealed a right
dominant system , a discreet 40% lesion in the proximal left main , a
discreet 30% lesion in the proximal left anterior descending
artery , 100% lesion in the first marginal branch of the left
circumflex artery , as well as 100% lesion in the second marginal
branch of the left circumflex artery. He has a discreet 80% lesion
in the proximal right coronary artery , as well as evidence of
severe aortic stenosis. During catheterization this revealed an RA
pressure of 10 , a pulmonary artery pressure of 49/20 , with wedge of
31. He had a thick cardiac output of 4.77 and cardiac index of
2.1.
Based on the findings of these catheterization results , the patient
was taken to the operating room on 2/13/02 with Dr. Opfer and Dr.
Gack for an aortic valve replacement with a #23
Carpentier-Edwards pericardial valve and mitral valvuloplasty with
an Alfieri suture repair , as well as coronary artery bypass graft
times three with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior
descending artery , left radial to obtuse marginal one , and left
radial to posterior descending artery. Postoperatively he
underwent our routine care and went to the Cardiac Surgical
Intensive Care Unit where he generally did well.
He remained on his aspirin and Lopressor , as well as Coumadin. He
was mildly tachycardic and his Lopressor dose was adjusted.
Because of his diabetes mellitus , he was placed on the Portland
protocol and remained on a full ten-day course of Flagyl and
Cefotaxime for his preoperative pneumonia. On postoperative day #1
he was transferred to the floor where he did well and was able to
ambulate at least to a chair and was deemed that he probably is not
a candidate to go home immediately but a candidate for
rehabilitation. He has been taken off his Portland protocol and
his staples have been discontinued.
On his pre-discharge examination he is stable with clean incisions ,
as well as stable sternum. He is now currently on room air and
will be discharged to rehabilitation.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q.hs to
maintain INR between 2 and 3 , aspirin , Diltiazem 30
mg t.i.d. , Simvastatin 20 mg q.d. , Colace 100 mg t.i.d. , Nexium 20
mg q.d. , Niferex-150 b.i.d. , Glipizide 5 mg b.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg
b.i.d. , and Lopressor 50 mg b.i.d. with CZI sliding scale.
