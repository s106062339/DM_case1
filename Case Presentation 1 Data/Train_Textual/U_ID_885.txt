BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
77 year old woman admitted with complaint of urinary frequency and AMS.
The patient has positive blood and urine cultures for Klebsiella and her
AFIB became tachy to 140's. She was also noted to have an elevated
troponin to 1.69 which rose to a max of 2.41 with no ekg changes. She was
rate controlled and started on Levofloxacin. Her mental status improved
and fever resolved. She remained tachycardic and nodal block was
supressing blood pressure. She was started on digoxin with excellent
response. HR stayed in 70-80's and up to 100's with exersion. Her cardiac
workup included an echocardiogram with RV dialation and wall akinesis
with apical sparing , a new finding since last echo in '03. Right sided
EKG neg. A PE was then ruled out with PE protocol CT. The following day
the patient had a adenosine MIBI that showed no perfusion defects. Her
INR was increasing due to the levofloxacin effect and was switched to
ceftriaxone consistant with blood culture succeptabilities. Follow up
blood cultures on 3/11 then demostrated gram positive cocci in clusters
and the patient was given 2 doses of vancomycin to cover potential staph
infection. Cultures were found to be skin flora and patient asymptomatic
and antibiotics d/c'd. Repeat cultures were negative. Patient was
discharged in good condition and will return to PCP for close follow up.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Call PCP with any changes in urinary symptoms , or fever >101.0. Return to
ER if any changes in mental status , chest pain , SOB , or syncope. Complete
the full course of antibiotics which cover the next 8days. F/U with PCP
within the next week with INR and digoxin levels. Do not use lasix unless
necessary and contact PCP if using more than 1-2 times per week due to
possible toxicity with digoxin use.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
VNA instructions: Please do vital signs checks. Patient needs a digoxin
level and INR checked weekly , and the first set of labs should be drawn
1-2 days after discharge. PCP will follow-up labs. Guiac + x 1 needs f/u.
TO THE PATIENT: We have altered cardiac medications for better rate
control. We have cancelled the coreg( carvedelol ) and
Norvasc( amilodipine ) and replaced them with a blood pressure medication ,
Toprol XL( Metoprolol XL ) to better control the rate of your atrial
fibrillation. The digoxin was also added for heart rate control.
