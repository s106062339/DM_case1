BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
62 F admitted w/ 1 month h/o increasing dyspnea & chest/neck pressure.
PMH notable for 1 ) CAD s/p RCA PTCA/stent 3/17 w/ repeat cath 9/27
patent w/o significant obstructive CAF; 2 ) DM on insulin; 3 ) HTN; 4 )
presumed diastolic dysfunction w/ 2/19 TTE showing LVEF=65-70%
w/ mild cLVH; 5 ) RA , recently started on low-dose prednisone 5 qd;
6 ) h/o asthma per pt; 7 ) depression; 8 ) fibromyalgia; 9 ) gout; 10 )
gastritis/DU; 11 ) s/p ventral hernia repair. Now , pt described
subacute chest/neck diffuse discomfort and episodic SOB possibly worse
w/ exertion though not clearly related to activity , breathing , meals ,
position , nitro and w/o further associated sxs. Notes medication
non-adherence at times due to depression and not re-filling meds;
includes no lasix x3+ weeks. Seen by PCP w/ SaO2 noted to be 91% on RA
( on home O2 prior but not currently for e/o PNA ) -> admitted.
Overall , evaluated for dyspnea w/ neck/chest discomfort & hyoxemia of
unclear etiology. Performed ABG to confirm hypoxemia: on 3L NC
7.45/45/79 ( Aa gradient elevated at approximately 158 ).
- Suspected DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION in context of ischemic heart dz/HTN
w/ exacerbation due to med compliance including no recent lasix. This
supported by a ) mild improvement w/ diuresis w/ lasix 40 IV qd
w/ resting & ambulatory SaO2s > 93% on 2L and resting SaO2 >90% ( though
decreased to 87% w/ ambulation ) at time of discharge; b ) underlying
CAD/HTN; c ) repeat TTE w/ low E/A suggestive of diastolic dyfxn; d )
crackles though no elevated JVD. However admission BNP=102 & still
some hypoxemia at DC & unclear crackles despite diuresis suggesting
additional process:
- PFTs suggest RVD ( ? obesity/CHF v other ); A-mibi w/o e/o active
ischemia; CXR/CT not suggestive of interstitial
abnormality/thromboembolic dz/PNA; episode of panic w/ more dypnea
possibly further explaining SOB though not hypoxemia. Outpt
consideration of full PFTS , OSA screen , screen for shunt ( not pursued
given correction w/ supplemental O2 )
- pt to follow w/ a ) pulm to see if possible ILD/other despite nl
CT given RVD/hypoxia/RA & consider full PFTs including lung volumes &
consider contribution of possible OSA/hypoventilation; b ) CHF clinic
( discharge weight = 186.4 though no relaible weights established ); c )
PCP; d ) psychiatry to enhance mood and med adherence. Established w/
home O2 transiently at 2L given borderline hypoxemia w/ ambulation on
RA and much improved sxs.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please note that we have intended to make NO changes in your
medications , in case you note any discrepanices , with the following
exception: we increased lisiniopril to 5 mg once a day. It is critical
that you take your medications , including the lasix - seek help from
your pharmacists/primary providers if needed as arrangements including
pill packs may be arranged. It is also critical that you see your
outpatient providers as outlined for continued evaluation though seek
medical attention immediately if you develop anything of concern.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Satisfactory
TO DO/PLAN:
Consider full PFTS , screen for sleep apnea , adjustment of diuresis
regimen , and TTE w/ bubble if no improvement ,
No dictated summary
