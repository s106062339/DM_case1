remained pain free throughout her hospital course and denied any
shortness of breath , increased lower extremity swelling , nausea ,
diaphoresis or other complaints. She had three sets of cardiac enzymes
return negative while in house. Her EKG showed evidence of old TWI with
some minimal flattening of T waves in II and V3. She had CXR showing no
acute cardiopulmonary process. She had adeno MIBI done on 12/10 showing no
evidence of EKG changes or symptoms with HR 51->71 and BP 124->70.
Final reading showed moderate ischemia in inferiolateral wall in L
circumflex territory with EF 59%. Her cardiologist Dr. Dossous was
called and recommended cath. She had a cardiac catheterization on 10/25 which
showed only distal disease and was not intervened upon. She will continue
with her medical management.

home. With her history of hypercoaguable disorders , she was started on
lovenox and coumadin 6mg and to continue lovenox for at least 5 days until
