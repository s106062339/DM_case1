BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
44 y/o M with h/o presyncopal episodes presents
with another presyncopal event. HPI: Patient was in his USOH until the
DOA when he was coming from the bathroom ( post
micturation ) and started feeling lightheaded , noted that
his peripheral vision was darkening , and noticed
some nausea. He was able to make his way to the bed
to lie down. He believes that he never
lost consciousness but was very close. He notes
this episode is characteristic of his last 2
episodes of presyncope. He notes no chest pain , SOB ,
or diaphoresis during the event. Once he
was conscious he called EMS for transport to the
MCMC .  Of note , he was here at the GGH about 6 weeks
ago for a rule out MI , which was negative. Review
of symptoms was significant for back pain
associated with spinal stenosis. Otherwise , it was
negative. PMH: spinal stenosis , morbid
obesity , diverticulosis , cervical stenosis ,
s/p laminectomy , s/p
sigmoidectomy. All:
