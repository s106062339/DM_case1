Discharge Date: 10/15/1995
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
LIST OF SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: DIABETES.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 54 year old , white
male with cardiac risk factors of
diabetes , borderline hypertension , male gender , and a positive
family history , who has no prior cardiac history , but now presents
to Leyson Memorial Hospital complaining of substernal chest
pain. Approximately six weeks ago , the patient lifted a 100-pound
bag and the next a.m. , noted substernal chest pressure without
associated symptoms. This pressure lasted approximately three to
five minutes and resolved spontaneously. Since then , the patient
has had two similar episodes of substernal chest pressure that have
occurred while he was exerting himself , once while running during a
basketball game and once again while running on the beach in
Westtpo Racecon Nari Neither episode had associated symptoms ( i.e. , radiation ,
nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis , palpitations ) , and both episodes
lasted less than five minutes and resolved with rest. On the night
prior to admission , the patient was working regripping his golf
clubs and noted a pulling sensation into his chest , which again
resolved with rest. On the morning of admission , the patient awoke
at 4:00 a.m. , noting a 6-7/10 substernal chest pressure associated
with diaphoresis. The pain persisted for five hours , at which time
the patient presented to MLMC .  At KGH , the patient was found to
have a blood pressure of 152/88 and a heart rate of 76. His
physical examination was benign. However , the patient's
electrocardiogram showed new ST depressions in V2-V5 , T wave
inversions in AVL , and flat T's in 1 and V6. The patient was
treated with two sublingual nitroglycerins and sent to the Mendwood Hospital .  On route to Icoson Hospital , the patient received
two sublingual nitroglycerin sprays. On arrival , the patient's
pain had dwindled to 1/10 , without associated symptoms. The
patient's blood pressure was 126/80 , with a heart rate of 80. The
patient was treated with an aspirin , a sublingual nitroglycerin ,
nitro paste , Lopressor 5 mg x 1 intravenously , and intravenous
heparin. Upon transfer to the CCU , the patient was pain free. A
repeat electrocardiogram demonstrated resolution of ST depressions
and flat T waves , but persistence of the T wave inversion in AVL.
The patient was admitted for further treatment and to rule out
myocardial infarction. The patient gives no history of edema ,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , or orthopnea. The patient denies
fevers , upper respiratory infection symptoms , cough , abdominal
pain , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , dysuria , or weight loss.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient's past medical history is
significant for diabetes. The patient has
kidney stones , is status post procedure three to four years ago ,
and a history of sinusitis.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: The patient's medications at the time of
admission included only Glyburide 2.5 mg
p.o. q.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is unmarried. He was the part owner
of a bar. He does not smoke , and he does not
drink.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient's mother had a myocardial infarction
in her 60's.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a pleasant , tan male in no
acute distress. Blood pressure , 126/80.
Heart rate , 80. Respiratory rate , 20. Temperature , 98. Oxygen
saturation , 100% on two liters. Head , eyes , ears , nose , and throat
examination was anicteric , with oropharynx benign. Neck was
supple , with no lymphadenopathy. Carotids were 2+ , with no bruits.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Back examination
demonstrated no costovertebral angle tenderness and no spinal
tenderness. Coronary examination revealed a regular rate and
rhythm , distant S1 and S2 , and no murmurs , rubs or gallops.
Abdominal examination was benign. Rectal examination showed guaiac
negative stool. Extremities showed no cyanosis , clubbing , or
edema , with pulses 2+ throughout , and no femoral bruits.
Neurologic examination revealed the patient to be alert and
oriented x 3.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory studies on admission revealed the
patient's electrolytes to be within normal
limits , except for a glucose of 293. The first CK returned 970 ,
with an MB fraction of 65.1. Magnesium was 1.6. CBC was within
normal limits , with a hematocrit of 44.1. Coag's were also normal
at 12.7 and 27.4. Chest x-ray showed no enlarged heart and no
infiltrate. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm , with a
rate of 60 , and no ST-T changes on the 15 of August , 1995.
However , electrocardiogram at the Bertgrand Hospital , pain free , showed normal
sinus rhythm , with a heart rate of 82 , T wave inversions , AVL , and
flat T's in lead 1.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of
acute myocardial infarction. Electrocardiogram
changes were consistent with lateral or anterolateral ischemia.
His peak CK's returned at 1 , 330 , with 54.5% MB fractions. The
patient was maintained on heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin for
72 hours after admission and was started on Lopressor and
enteric-coated aspirin at admission. The patient remained chest
pain free for the five days post myocardial infarction and
underwent a submax ETT on the 5 of August , 1995. In addition , an
electrocardiogram was performed , which showed a left ventricle with
73% ejection fraction , upper limits of normal size , and a question
of inferior wall hypokinesis. On the 24 of June , the patient underwent a
submax ETT , which was stopped secondary to chest tightness , with
diagnostic electrocardiogram changes , maximal heart rate of 96 ,
blood pressure of 145/82 , electrocardiogram with 2 mm ST
depressions , persisting into recovery. Because of a positive ETT ,
the patient subsequently underwent cardiac catheterization , which
showed a proximal left circ lesion 70% stenosed , which was
percutaneous transhepatic coronary angioplastied to 20% residual ,
as well as a mid-left circ lesion 70% stenosed , which was
percutaneous transhepatic coronary angioplastied to a 30% residual.
The left anterior descending was found to be diffusely diseased ,
without focal stenoses , and the proximal right coronary artery
showed a 60% shelf-like lesion. The patient did not experience
chest pain or shortness of breath during the procedure. Post
cardiac catheterization/percutaneous transhepatic coronary
angioplasty , the patient was maintained on his glipizide and
atenolol , 50 mg p.o. q.d. , and enteric-coated aspirin , as well as
heparin overnight. Two days after the cardiac catheterization , the
patient underwent a second submax ETT. This he performed without
chest discomfort or electrocardiogram changes.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home on the 16 of September .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient's condition at the time of
discharge was stable.
DISCHARGE PLAN: The patient will receive diabetic teaching as
an outpatient with CH and will follow up with
Dr. Kalert .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d. , sublingual
nitroglycerins p.r.n. chest pain , and
Glucotrol 5 mg p.o. q.d.
