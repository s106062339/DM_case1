HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 51 year-old morbidly
obese black female with a history of
restrictive lung disease , obstructive sleep apnea , recurrent lower
extremity deep venous thromboses requiring multiple
hospitalizations who was initially evaluated on March , 1996 for
right knee pain. Evaluation revealed a small right knee effusion
consistent with mechanical derangement secondary to obesity. The
tap was negative for crystals and had negative cultures. The
patient was initially supposed to go home , however due to
inadequate support , she was kept overnight on the evening of September , 1996. Overnight she received Vistaril , Percocet as well as
some Demerol and Oxycodone. On the morning of March , 1996 , she
was found to be unresponsive with bloody saliva dripping from her
mouth. A Code Green was called. They were unable to find a blood
pressure. The patient was intubated. Dopamine was started.
Narcan was given. The blood pressure recovered. The patient
awakened and the patient's initial arterial blood gas prior to
intubation was 7.04 pH , pCO2 137 and pO2 of 85 and she was
subsequently admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Her past medical history is significant for
a restrictive lung disease. Past pulmonary
function tests revealed an FEV of 1.8 which is in the 56th
percentile and FEV1 of 1.6 which is in the 59th percentile , TLC of
3.3 in the 54th percentile and DLCO at 116th percentile. She has
been on long term home oxygen with oxygen saturation between 85%
and 90% on two liters of nasal cannula. Arterial blood gases on
prior admissions have revealed pO2 in 50 , pCO2 in the high 40s to
low 50s. She has a history of obstructive sleep apnea. She has
been evaluated in the past with even trace apnea screen in August
of 1994 which revealed approximately 19 apnea events in just over
10 hours. The oxygen saturation decreased to 61% at the minimum
and subsequently she had respiratory monitoring in September of 1995 with
C-PAP which revealed a decrease in the apnea episodes to 19 events
in about 480 minutes with oxygen saturation decreasing to a minimum
of 71%. Apparently , by report , attempts had been made to start the
patient on the C-PAP at home , but the patient had been resistant
and she has a long history of medical non-compliance. She has a
history of recurrent deep venous thromboses in which she has had
multiple medical admissions , most recently about six in the past
year , most recently in October of 1996 , for cellulitis of the left
lower extremity , in July of 1996 , bilateral calf tenderness with
negative non-invasive studies and in September of 1996 , most recently
with right lower extremity cellulitis and this was complicated by
apparent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare. The patient
has had multiple VQ scans in the past , all of which have been low
probability. The patient has been on chronic Coumadin , however
there is a question of whether or not , she has been taking it
regularly. There has also been a question in the past of possible
diastolic dysfunction. In September of 1994 , she had an
echocardiogram which showed some left ventricular hypertrophy , no
regional wall motion abnormalities and an ejection fraction of
approximately 55% , no right ventricular hypertrophy or tricuspid
regurgitation. Other past medical history includes a history of
depression. The patient has been managed with Zoloft 50 mg p.o. q.
day. She is status post midline hernia repair. She is status post
bilateral tubal ligation. The patient has chronic hypoxemia ,
obesity , obstructive sleep apnea , chronic lower extremity deep
venous thromboses and obstructive lung disease.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Diltiazem 120 mg p.o. q. day. 2 )
Glyburide 10 mg p.o. q. day. 3 )
Albuterol 2 puffs q.i.d. p.r.n. 4 ) K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. q. day. 5 )
Axid 150 mg p.o. q.h.s. 6 ) Zoloft 50 mg p.o. q. day. 7 ) Lasix
20 mg p.o. q. day. 8 ) Coumadin alternating 10 mg with 7.5 mg p.o.
q. day.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Significant for the patient living alone. She
occasional has her son stay with her. She is
divorced and she has refused chronic care in the past.
HABITS: Positive for cigarettes about a 20 pack year history. No
alcohol , no intravenous drugs.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Pulmonary: The patient was admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit on March , 1996
status post a respiratory arrest thought to be secondary to
hypercarbia through the combination of the patient's underlying
lung disease as well as excessive sedation. She was intubated on
March , 1996 and quickly extubated on April , 1996 without
complications. Her chest x-ray on admission was significant for a
mild interstitial pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. After
extubation , the patient was weaned to bi-PAP with which she was
able to maintain saturations between 86-90% while in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit. The patient was transferred to the floor on
February , 1996. Given the patient's history of restrictive lung
disease , it was thought that it was time to have a full work-up to
search for a possible etiologies , questioning possible obesity vs.
parenchymal disease. She had an echocardiogram on August , 1996 ,
which revealed an ejection fraction of 75% , mild left ventricular
hypertrophy , no regional wall motion abnormalities , a top normal
sized right ventricle , trace tricuspid insufficiency and a
suggested pulmonary arterial pressure in the range of 36 mm of
Mercury plus the estimated right atrial pressure. This
echocardiogram was performed with a bubble study and there was no
obvious intra-cardiac shunt either by color doppler or saline
infusion. They were unable to exclude diastolic dysfunction given
the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy. Her chest CT on
August , 1996 was significant for cardiomegaly and pulmonary
edema , patchy opacities in the right apex and lung bases with a
nodular quality of unclear etiology and a lucent lesion in the
right lobe of the liver that was too small to characterize. In
order to further help sort out the etiology of her restrictive lung
disease , the patient underwent a PA gram on September , 1996 to rule
out the possibility of chronic pulmonary emboli. This study
revealed no evidence of pulmonary emboli. She had a normal
pulmonary vascular distribution , elevated right heart pressures
with pulmonary arterial pressure of 44/13 with a mean of 28 mm of
Mercury , right ventricular pressure 52/2 with a mean of 20 mm of
Mercury and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 23. The
Pulmonary Service had been consulted and it was thought that it was
difficult to sort out exactly what was going on. It was unclear
what the nodular lesions described on the CT represented , whether
it was inflammation or some sort of firm nodule. It was decided to
follow-up on the CT in the future and to have the patient had a
repeat sleep study as well as repeat pulmonary function tests. The
overall impression was that her restrictive lung disease was most
likely secondary to obesity. While the patient was on the floor ,
we attempted to restart her on the bi-PAP , however the patient
resisted using both the C-PAP and the bi-PAP practically every
night complaining that she had an upper respiratory infection that
made it difficult for her to wear the machine. On the evening that
she did actually try both the C-PAP and the bi-PAP , she was noted
to have labored breathing with the C-PAP at 5 mm of Mercury and
four liters nasal cannula with a pulse oximetry dropping to 81%.
When she switched to bi-PAP with settings of 12 mm of Mercury
inspiratory and 7 mm of Mercury expiratory , she was able to
maintain oxygen saturations between 88% and as high as 93% oxygen
saturation. Her oxygen saturations throughout hospitalization
ranged between 91-93% on two liters nasal cannula during the day
and as well as 88% overnight. It was decided that the patient
given her history would require bi-PAP on discharge as well as her
home oxygen.
2 ) Infectious Disease: The patient as noted above spiked a
temperature to 101 degrees on March , 1996 while in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit and subsequently never had elevated
temperatures nor an elevated white blood cell count. She was
started on Clindamycin and Ofloxacin intravenously and then
switched to p.o. on February , 1996 to complete a ten day course.
On March , 1996 , the patient as stated , remained afebrile
throughout her hospitalization and never had an elevated white
blood cell count. She did complain of upper respiratory symptoms
beginning on February , 1996 described as general head fullness ,
sinus tenderness and nasal congestion. She was started on Afrin 2
puffs b.i.d. for three days with some relief as well as Robitussin
and Sudafed. Her physical examination was notable some maxillary
sinusitis and the patient was actually discharged after a brief
time on Afrin nasal spray.
3 ) Cardiovascular: Echocardiogram was performed during this
admission and is as described above. The patient remained
hemodynamically stable throughout this admission.
4 ) Hematology: The patient had a history of recurrent lower
extremity deep venous thromboses. She was maintained on Heparin
until all of her procedures had been completed and was restarted on
Coumadin on September , 1996. Her PT and PTT were followed until
the point that she had established a therapeutic INR. On August , 1996 , her PT and PTT were notable for a PT of 17.5 with a PTT
of greater than 200 and INR of 2.2. Heparin was discontinued and a
repeat PTT on the evening of July , 1996 revealed a PT of 18.5
and a PTT of 67.6 and an INR of 2.5. She was discharged the next
day on 7.5 mg of Coumadin q.h.s. Of note , the patient had been
admitted with about a 2 X 2 cm ulcer of her medial left malleolus
which appeared to heal well with granulation and scarred by the
time she had been discharged.
5 ) Rheumatology: The patient as noted was admitted for evaluation
of right knee pain. The patient did not complain of right pain
subsequent to her discharge from the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
Her cultures and crystals were negative and she is to follow-up as
an outpatient with the Rheumatologist in their clinic.
6 ) Endocrine: The patient maintained stable bowel sounds on
Glyburide 10 mg p.o. q. day.
7 ) Gastrointestinal: The patient remained stable and was able to
tolerate a low cholesterol , low saturated fat diet and was
maintained on Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. However , on the date of
discharge , the patient was complaining of a burning sensation in
her throat after drinking orange juice which tended to come and go ,
but did not radiate and she was switched from Axid to Prilosec 20
mg p.o. q. day on March , 1996.
8 ) Gynecology: While on the floor , the patient started
complaining of some vaginal spotting. She has menopausal since her
40s and has had not had any recent gynecological following. It was
decided for the patient to either follow-up with her primary care
physician or with the GYN clinic at N'ssciences Memorial Hospital for evaluation of this spotting for ruling out endometrial
carcinoma.
9 ) Neurological: The patient did not demonstrate any evidence of
depression and was stable on Zoloft.
10 ) General Care: The patient underwent Physical Therapy and
Occupational Therapy throughout the hospitalization. It was
thought that she would benefit greatly from inpatient pulmonary
rehabilitation or possibly weight loss reduction , however the
patient repeatedly declined pulmonary rehabilitation and weight
loss reduction and felt that she would be able to manage herself at
home.
The patient was discharged on March , 1996 in stable condition
to home with VNA services to follow-up on her blood sugars , her
home oxygen as well as her bi-PAP.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1 ) Lasix 20 mg p.o. q. day. 2 )
Glyburide 10 mg p.o. q. day. 3 )
Procardia XL 30 mg p.o. q. day. 4 ) Zoloft 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. 5 )

b.i.d. times three days.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to follow-up with Dr. Isidro Ernesto Laurila on
August , 1996. She also had an appointment on January , 1996 with the GYN Clinic. Pulmonary follow-up is as follows:
On February , 1996 at 9:00 AM , she is to have a repeat CT to
follow-up the nodularities found on the most recent CT. On
February , 1996 at 10:30 AM , she is to have a pulmonary function
test and to follow-up at 11:30 AM with the Pulmonary Clinic. She
is to call Rheumatology at her convenience.
The patient was to proceed with bi-PAP , however due to the
need for medical assistance , she may not receive it for another two
weeks and is to continue with her home oxygen.
