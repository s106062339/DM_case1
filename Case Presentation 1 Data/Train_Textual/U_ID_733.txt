DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA/PAROXYSMAL
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 54 year old man status
post AVR admitted for tachycardia.
Patient is a 54 year old with history of high blood pressure and
status post aortic valve replacement with homograft for chronic AI
from bicuspid aortic valve. His postoperative course was
complicated by prolonged fevers , he had multiple blood cultures
drawn and only one culture grew Hemophilus parahaemolyticus in the
sputum , and only one out of many blood cultures grew coagulase
negative Staphylococcus. He was discharged from the surgical
service on July , 1996 on Lopressor and Percocet. He was sent
home feeling well except for persistent low grade temperatures.
One day prior to admission , patient had mild shortness of breath
but denied orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea with no chest
pain. He awoke the morning of admission with no complaints but was
found by VNA to have a rapid heart rate and was sent to the
Emergency Room. Patient denied shortness of breath , dyspnea on
exertion , cough , pleuritic chest pain , dizziness , and palpitations.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Included: 1 ) Status post AVR for AI from
bicuspid aortic valve as above. 2 ) History
of polio in 1955. 3 ) Hypertension. 4 ) History of knee surgery.
ALLERGIES: He had no known drug allergies.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Lopressor 25 b.i.d. and enteric coated
aspirin 325 a day.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He was married with children , worked in the
clothing industry , and denied cigarette and
alcohol use.
FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for coronary artery disease and negative
for cardiomyopathy , deep venous thrombosis , and
pulmonary embolus.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He was a healthy appearing male alert in no
apparent distress. Temperature was 99.1 ,
blood pressure 118/70 , pulse of 90 , and 97% O2 saturations on two
liters of oxygen. HEENT: Oropharynx was clear with pupils equally
round and reactive to light and extraocular movements intact.
NECK: Supple with no lymphadenopathy , no jugular venous
distention , and carotids were 2+ bilaterally with no bruits.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , rubs , or
gallops. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. ABDOMEN:
Soft , good bowel sounds , nontender , nondistended , and no
hepatosplenomegaly. RECTAL: Examination was negative for blood.
EXTREMITIES: No edema. NEUROLOGICAL: Examination was nonfocal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , SMA 7 significant for
potassium of 4.6 , BUN of 19 , and
creatinine 0.9 , white count was 10 , hematocrit of 33.6 , platelet
count of 377 , PT 13.8 with INR of 1.3 , and PTT of 23.6. Chest
x-ray showed no infiltrate and no effusion. EKG showed atrial
flutter at 156 , borderline left ventricular hypertrophy initially
then after 5 mg of intravenous Verapamil , he converted to atrial
fibrillation at 100 , and there were no specific ST-T wave changes.
He also underwent VQ scan which showed high intermediate
probability scan.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the cardiology B
service for management of atrial
fibrillation/atrial flutter and question of pulmonary embolus. He
was heparinized and was continued on Lopressor for rate control.
He was placed on cardiac monitor. In addition because of the low
grade fevers , more blood cultures were obtained. He underwent a PA
gram on January , 1996 which showed no evidence of pulmonary
embolism , normal right heart pressures , and bibasilar subsegmental
atelectasis. Patient was begun on Coumadin and he was also seen by
infectious disease consultation who felt that he should be off all
antibiotics. He also underwent a transesophageal echo on January ,
1996 which showed mildly dilated left ventricle with low normal
systolic function , aortic homograft with no vegetation or fluid
collection around the annulus , trace aortic insufficiency was
present , mitral valve was mildly thickened with 1+ mitral
regurgitation but no obvious vegetations , tricuspid and pulmonic
valves were normal with no vegetations , and left atrium was also
normal with no thrombus. Patient continued to have low grade
fevers with no obvious evidence of infection and infectious disease
consultation service suggested that patient be discharged to home
