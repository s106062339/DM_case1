SERVICE: General Medical Service , Ma Ahendbrown
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSIS: HEMORRHAGIC CYSTITIS.
IDENTIFICATION: Mr. Ranweiler is a 69 year old gentleman with a
history of adult onset diabetes mellitus ,
peripheral vascular disease , chronic hemorrhagic cystitis who is
currently transfusion dependent , who was admitted with congestive
heart failure and elevated CK , MB in the setting of profound anemia
and presents for a blood transfusion.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient has a long , complex
urologic history which includes
prostate cancer which was treated with radiation approximately
twenty years ago. More recently , superficial bladder cancer which
was treated with partial resection. He developed hematuria
approximately April 1995. A workup revealed hemorrhagic cystitis
which was felt to be secondary to prior radiation treatments. He
has required approximately 1 unit of red cells per week for the
past three months to keep up with ongoing urologic blood loss.
The patient has no known cardiac history. His risk factors include
diabetes , hypertension , tobacco use , and male sex. No history of
hypercholesterolemia or family history. He describes 4-5 episodes
of chest tightness occurring over the past five years , the last
episode occurring approximately three months ago. He does note
progressive pedal edema over the past six weeks and over the past
two to three days has had increasing fatigue and dyspnea on
exertion. On the day prior to admission , routine VNA blood draw
revealed a hematocrit of 17. His primary care physician was
notified and the patient was instructed to report to Fiville Gadelp Medical Center on the day of admission for transfusion. Repeat
hematocrit on the day of admission was 18. He received two units
of packed red cells and chemotherapy infusion and shortly after
transfusion developed shortness of breath without chest pain.
Chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure. His
initial CK was 770 with 70 MB fraction. The patient was
transferred to the Emergency Room for further evaluation where he
was treated with topical Nitro paste , 40 mg of IV Lasix , resulting
in 1500 cc of urine output. Aspirin and heparin were held
secondary to hemorrhagic cystitis. Beta blocker was also held
secondary to question of bronchospasm.
The patient was then transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for
further treatment.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. AODM. 2. Peripheral vascular disease.
3. Neuropathy. 4. Prostate cancer. 5.
Bladder cancer in 1995 and 1990. 6. Status post appendectomy. 7.
History of TIAs three to four years ago. Workup revealed 50%
bilateral carotid stenosis. 8. Chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease. 9. Hypertension.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin causes edema. Steroids cause cytosis.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Cardizem CD
180 mg p.o. q.day , folate 1 mg p.o. q.day ,
iron sulfate 300 mg p.o. q.day , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
FAMILY HISTORY: Mother died of leukemia. Father had a CVA and
kidney problems. No known coronary artery
disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Two pack per day smoking , 1-2 drinks per day. The
patient is a retired teacher at a Tyfranxingcolnlu Sxingscond A He currently lives alone and is single.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: This is a pleasant older gentleman in no
apparent distress. Temperature 98.6 , blood
pressure 110/62 , heart rate 98. Oxygen saturation of 97% on 2
liters. HEENT: Examination is benign , no JVD , JVP was at 7 cm ,
neck was supple. CHEST: Bibasilar crackles. CARDIAC: 2+
carotids , no bruits , regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs , rubs , or
gallops. ABDOMEN: Two frontal scars , liver was palpable 2 cm
below the right costal margin. The abdomen was soft , non-tender ,
nondistended , normal bowel sounds , no masses. BACK: No CVA or
spinal tenderness. RECTAL: Guaiac negative in the Emergency Room.
EXTREMITIES: 1+ left greater than right pedal edema. Superficial
ulcers on bilateral soles. NEURO: Alert and oriented times three.
Nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Sodium 132 , potassium 4.7 , chloride
96 , bicarb 25 , BUN 7 , creatinine
0.9 , glucose 186 , CK of 776 , MB 70.5. LFTs were within normal
limits. Hematocrit was 28.3 , white count 10.4 , platelet count 283 ,
PT 13.5 , PTT 26.2 , normal differential.
Urinalysis grossly bloody , 10-20 white cells.
Chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure with small bilateral
effusions , right greater than left , plus Kerley B-lines.
EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 90 , intervals 212/72/368 , and axis 7
degrees. No ischemic changes.
ASSESSMENT & PLAN: This is a 69 year old gentleman with multiple
cardiac risk factors , chronic anemia secondary
to severe hemorrhagic cystitis , no transfusion dependent , who was
admitted with congestive heart failure after blood transfusion and
positive CK , MB. No definitive EKG changes and no clear history of
angina but recent history of increased pedal edema. The patient
likely had recent myocardial infarction and congestive heart
failure in the setting of transfusion.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Care Unit
for further care. As mentioned above , heparin
and aspirin were held secondary to the risk of worsening
hemorrhagic cystitis. The patient received further blood
transfusions to maintain a hematocrit greater than 30. He remained
in the Cardiac Care Unit overnight. Serial CKs revealed an A set
of 776 ( MB 70.5 ) , B set 747 ( MB 54.7 ) , C set 564 ( MB 33.2 ). CTNI
was 25.1. EKG's were without evolution. The patient was therefore
ruled in for a non Q-wave myocardial infarction. An echocardiogram
was performed on 4/17/96 which showed normal LV function , mild LVH ,
no regional wall motion abnormalities but of a somewhat suboptimal
quality. The patient received a total of four units of red blood
cells with a subsequent rise in hematocrit from 17 to 30.1 by the
first hospital day and received initially 40 mg of IV Lasix in the
Emergency Room , followed by two doses of 20 mg with excellent urine
output.
The patient was transferred from the CCU to General Medical
Service , Scogard on his second hospital day , 9/23/96. His post MI
course was uncomplicated , notable only for two runs of
non-sustained ventricular tachycardia overnight on the first
hospital day. The patient had no recurrent angina and no recurrent
evidence of congestive heart failure.
He underwent a routine post MI submax ETT on 9/3/96. The patient
went 4 minutes and 4 seconds with a peak work load of 31 , peak
heart rate of 80 , and peak blood pressure of 160/80. He stopped
secondary to fatigue. He occasional PVC's but no chest pain and no
ST changes. The test was thought to show no evidence of ischemia
but had a low work load. It was thought appropriate to discharge
the patient to home for further medical management and further
urologic workup as an outpatient. The most important medical
intervention would be to keep his hematocrit greater than 30 with
vigilant monitoring. During this admission , the patient received a
total of six units of packed red cells. and had a hematocrit of
30.9 on discharge.
From a urologic standpoint , the patient was followed by Urology
during his hospitalization , who felt that his condition was
secondary to radiation cystitis. Given that he was now having
hematuria to the extent of requiring frequent transfusions , surgery
i.e. a urinary diversion with ileal conduit , will most likely be
necessary in the near future. He will continue to follow-up with
Urology as an outpatient.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Ferrous sulfate 300 mg p.o. q.day , folic
acid 1 mg p.o. q.day , Glyburide 10 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , sublingual nitroglycerin
p.r.n. chest pain.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged in good
condition and will follow-up with Dr. Arthur Matney and also with Dr. Silos as well as Urology.
