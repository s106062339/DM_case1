Discharge Date: 10/8/1990
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient was an essentially healthy
79 year old retired garment industry
worker , followed by Dr. Cecil W. Maslen , the internist at
Chicarl O Hospital for the question of transient ischemic
attacks. On the evening of admission , the patient and his wife
noted fatigue , light-headedness and 3 episodes of diaphoresis. The
patient took 1 to 2 ounces of ethanol for relaxation and several
hours later while attempting to climb stairs fell and was unable to
get up. Soon after , he had one episode of melenotic soft stool in
large volume without frank blood and then a moderate amount of
coffee ground emesis. The emergency medical technicians were
called , and in the ambulance the patient had a blood pressure of
110/68 , heart rate 110. At the Ipal Health
emergency ward , his blood pressure had dropped to 95/60 and he was
symptomatically orthostatic. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was
performed in the emergency ward , which showed an actively bleeding
1 cm antral lesion in the greater curvature , which was cauterized.
This was thought to be consistent with a pancreatic cyst or
leiomyoma , or less likely a metastatic lesion , along with some mild
esophagitis. He had no previous history of peptic ulcer disease.
The patient takes aspirin 1 to 2 tablets per day for several months
as question treatment for transient ischemic attack and for his hip
pain. He also has daily ingestion of ethenol , approximately 2 to 3
ounces , for many years. There was no history of nausea , vomiting ,
diarrhea , weight loss , abdominal pain , anorexia or any other
constitutional symptoms. There is a remote history of abdominal
pain and spastic colon with a negative work-up in 1976 , including a
Barium enema , upper gastrointestinal series and abdominal
ultrasound. He was admitted to the Suma Tondinoa Ylu County Hospital
Medical Intensive Care Unit , where his course was notable for a
5-unit packed red blood cell transfusion with stabilization of his
hematocrit and vital signs. The initial hematocrit was 21 and he
was transfused up to the 37 range. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION
included aspirin 2 po q day and Westcort Cream for psoriasis. PAST
MEDICAL HISTORY was notable for chronic psoriasis , vertigo question
transient ischemic attack , status post multiple excisions for basal
cell skin carcinoma , history of hiatal hernia with a question of
reflux esophagitis , status post suprapubic prostatectomy for benign
prostatic hypertrophy , status post herniorrhaphy , status post
appendectomy , question of glucose intolerance diet controlled ,
status post right cataract surgery with lens implantation. FAMILY
HISTORY is notable for multiple siblings healthy in their late
80's , one brother with pancreatic carcinoma , hypertension in mother
and sister , no history of other systemic illnesses. SOCIAL HISTORY
reveals the patient is a retired woman's clothing manufacturer , who
lives in Field S with his wife , who is a Well Sirco Hospital employee. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS is negative , except for the
vertigo and occasional episodes of diaphoresis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a 79 year old man looking
remarkably well and fit. He was afebrile ,
pulse 60 , blood pressure 130/72. His skin was well tanned with
multiple psoriatic patches on the lower extremities. Head , eyes ,
ears , nose and throat examination was unremarkable. Neck was
normal. Chest was clear. Cardiac examination showed S4 , S1 and
S2 , no S3 , the murmur heard at admission was absent. Abdomen was
soft , flat , without hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities showed pulses
to be intact without clubbing , cynosis or edema. Neurologic
examination was nonfocal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: The electrocardiogram was normal. Chest
x-ray was normal. Urinalysis showed mild
pyuria and hematuria , which will be followed. Laboratory values of
note included a normal SMA-20 , except for a globulin of 1.6.
Hematocrit was 37 , with a normal differential.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent several diagnostic studies ,
including a repeat upper gastrointestinal
endoscopy , which showed the 1-cm gastric antral lesion. It also
showed some thickened folds within the stomach , which were
biopsied. The lesion was not biopsied for fear of rebleeding. The
patient also underwent an abdominal computerized tomography , which
showed a 1 to 2 cm cystic appearing lesion felt to be consistent
with either dilated pancreatic duct or a small pancreatic
pseudocyst. There was no evidence of intra-abdominal malignancy.
The patient also underwent an upper gastrointestinal series , which
was unremarkable. On 22 of July , the patient developed a tender left
big toe , which was initially thought to be gout or another
inflammatory arthritis , for example psoriatic arthritis , and he was
evaluated by the Rheumatology Service. The patient underwent a
joint tap , the findings of which were unremarkable. He also had
some erythematous changes on the forefoot , and the picture was
thought to be consistent with a mild cellulitis , with perhaps the
portal of entry being a psoriatic plaque. He was treated with
intravenous Kefzol and the erythema resolved overnight. The other
complicating issue is a mild elevation in liver enzymes noted on
the day before admission. This needs to be followed.
DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE include Pepcid 20 mg po bid
( this may be the cause of elevated liver function
tests ) , Velosef 500 mg po qid times 7 days , Westcort Cream.
Disposition is to home. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE is good. FOLLOW-UP
care is to be provided by Dr. Marcelino F. Deaquino at the Tonver Thohang Baybrooksnu Hospital , and Dr. Antwan Pooyouma in the Division of
Gastroenterology at the Denon Of Medical Center .
