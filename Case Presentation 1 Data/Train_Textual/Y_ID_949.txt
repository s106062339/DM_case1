Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: LANIE , ANIBAL M.D.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Septic shock from right prosthetic knee ,
infection with MRSA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Goettl is an 83-year-old
gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease , congestive
heat failure , diabetes , and chronic renal insufficiency , status
post bilateral knee replacement 10 years prior who presented to
an outside hospital on the February , 2005 , with one day of mild
confusion , fever , and lethargy. He was initially thought to have
left lower lobe pneumonia , but subsequently left knee effusion
was noted and an arthrocentesis was performed with consistent
with septic arthritis. He was admitted to the hospital for
broad-spectrum antibiotics ( cefepime and vancomycin ) and
subsequently developed hypotension requiring vasopressor support
with dopamine as well as an increased oxygen requirement. His
sepsis was also marked by acute renal failure , mental status
changes , and a non-ST elevation MI. He was transferred to
Su Quierfield Hospital per family request.
At the time of admission , the patient was lethargic but
interactive , orient to person and place and complained of
fatigue , but denied any pain or chest pain or shortness of
breath.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Obtained from family , disclosed one week of
left leg and hip pain , low grade fevers , lethargy , and increased
high-grade fevers starting the day prior to admission. The
patient had no recent travels , sick contacts , trauma , or
exposures.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , coronary artery disease ,
diabetes complicated by neuropathy , retinopathy , and nephropathy ,
congestive heart failure , hyperlipidemia , chronic renal
insufficiency , status post distant left nephrectomy for unclear
reasons , neuroendocrine tumor , status post chemotherapy and
reception , and esophageal reason felt to be cured , status post
bilateral total knee replacement , status post right total hip
replacement , DVT , PE , status post IVC filter , and chronic lower
extremity lymphedema.
MEDICATIONS AT TRANSFER: Vancomycin , cefepime , atenolol , and
lisinopril.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME: Atenolol 50 p.o. q.d. , Lipitor , lisinopril
10 mg p.o. q.d. , and Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
ALLERGIES: NKDA.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with his wife and denies any
tobacco , alcohol , or drug use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Temperature 97.8 , heart rate
80 , blood pressure 91/52 , respirations 18 , and satting 95% on 6
liters of nasal cannula. The patient was noted to be lethargic
but otherwise had no acute distress. He was oriented to person
and place. Lungs examination revealed a few basilar crackles ,
but otherwise was clear. Cardiac examination had a regular rate
and rhythm with 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at left sternal
border nonradiating. Abdomen was unremarkable. His right knee
had a large effusion with erythema , tenderness to palpation , and
limited range of motion.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Notable for a sodium of 132; a
potassium of 5.1; and a creatinine of 4.0 , up from a baseline of
1.5. White count was 11 , hematocrit was 37.6 , and platelets were
217. Lactic acid was 0.8. Troponin was 0.71. LFTs were within
normal limits.
DIAGNOSTIC DATA: Chest x-ray revealed poor inspiratory effort
and question of left lingular infiltrate , mild pulmonary edema ,
and a calcified left anterior descending artery. EKG showed
normal sinus rhythm with incomplete right-bundle branch block , 2
to 3 mm SCD depression in the V3 through V5.
Micro from January , 2005 , Staphylococcus aureus with
sensitivities pending. Blood cultures form January , 2005 ,
Gram-positive cocci , speciation and sensitivities pending.
IMPRESSION: This is an 82-year-old gentleman with septic shock
likely secondary to infection of his right prosthetic knee
complicated by bacteremia , acute renal failure , myocardial
injury , and mental status changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Infectious Disease. The patient was found to have MRSA ,
septic arthritis complicated by septic shock , bacteremia and
acute renal failure. He was brought to the operating room with
removal of his prosthetic knee and debridement of his surrounding
area with drain replacement. He was started on a 42-day course
of vancomycin 1 g q.12h. and is currently on day #18 as of
February , 2005. He was also noted to have pneumonia on the
left side that bronchoscopy was also thought to be MRSA
pneumonia. Per ID consult , he was started the linezolid for
better lung penetration and is currently on day #8 of 14. He has
been afebrile now with negative cultures since then. Of note , on
bronchoscopy , there was cytopathic changes consistent with HSV
infection , and he was treated with a course of acyclovir also per
infectious disease this is probably unnecessary and presented
contamination from an old lesion.
2. Pulmonary. The patient had a nosocomial pneumonia with MRSA
and was intubated for inability to handle secretions and mental
status changes. He had a tracheostomy placed and has been
tolerating that breathing on trach collar during the day and
resting on pressure support of 5 and 5 overnight. BBG are
followed with a PC02 goal of less than 55 and a pH of greater
than 7.30 when these were correlated to his arterial blood gas.
3. Cardiovascular. The patient was noted to be in distributive
shock on Neo-Synephrine with a troponin leak secondary to demand
physiology. He had an echo performed , which demonstrated
diastolic dysfunction and preserved ejection fraction. He also
had an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response in the setting of an acute septic shock. He is
currently in normal sinus rhythm with cardiac enzymes having
resolved. He has been maintained on aspirin , Lipitor , and
Lopressor for blood pressure and rate control.
4. Renal. The patient was noted to be in acute renal failure ,
which is now resolved and with a creatinine at back to baseline
of 1.2 to 1.5.
5. Hematology. The patient has anemia of chronic disease with
crit at baseline of 30. He should be transfused for transfusion
goal of 26 , although there has been no evidence of acute blood
loss during his hospital course other than perioperative excepted
acute drop in crit which is now resolved.
6. Endocrine. The patient was on 50 units of Lantus as an
outpatient but did have episodes of hypoglycemia in the setting
of sepsis and poor nutritional status. He is currently on Lantus
20 units , which can be slowly increased if his blood sugars are
running high. Additional glucose management can be maintained
with sliding scale insulin.
7. Pain/Psych. The patient had peristent delirium likely the
combination of infection pain , ICU delirium , and treatment with
Versed and fentanyl. He had a head CT , which was negative for
any acute process , and once his intravenous narcotic and
benzodiazepine were stopped , his delirium rapidly cleared over 24
to 48 hours. The patient is now on a fentanyl patch for pain
control , which can be increased as his sensorium clears and
Haldol was effective for agitation as well.
8. Gastrointestinal/FEN. The patient had PEG placement to
supplement nutrition and has been tolerating tube feeds without
difficulty.
9. Prophylaxis. The patient was maintained on Nexium and
subcutaneous Lovenox.
10. Code Status. The patient is full code.
