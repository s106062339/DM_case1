Tylenol , ducolox , Mylanta , lactulose , Seroquel 100 mg , prednisone

SOCIAL HISTORY: Divorced with two children. No alcohol use
recently.
FAMILY HISTORY: Father died of a MI at 73. Her mother died in
her 80s of emphysema.
LABORATORY DATA: The patient had a creatinine of 1 , her ALT was
25 , AST was 35 , her hematocrit was 33 , her white count was 6.6 ,
and her platelets were 241 , 000. She had normal differential.
Her albumin was 3.5. Her urinalysis was dark , with 3+
leukoesterase , negative nitrates , greater than 200 white blood
cells per high peripheral , 2-4 red blood cells per high
peripheral , 1+ bacteria. Her EKG showed a sinus rhythm of 100.
Her left bundle branch block with a QTc of 500 , but no change
compared to baseline.
Her head CT showed an old right middle cerebral artery implant.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for initial
presentation with somnolence and altered mental status with one
hypotensive blood pressure by EMS , but subsequently no
hypotension in the absence of fluid resuscitation. Her urine
culture appeared to indicate an infection , and so she was covered
with antibiotics initially. It was also determined that she had
a significant polypharmacy and enumerable sedating medications at
her rehabilitation and there was suspicion that the medications
contributed to her initial presentation of somnolence and altered
mental status.
1. Infectious disease: The patient was initially treated with
vancomycin for a presumed repeated MRSA UTI. However , her urine
culture did not grow any bacteria , it only drew out yeast. Thus ,
she was transitioned over to a ciprofloxacin 700 mg p.o. b.i.d.
regime for a total of 12 days for a presumed urinary tract
infection.
2. F/E/N: She was tolerating oral food and medications and a
Nutrition consult was obtained. She had calorie counts which
showed adequate intake. She did not have any other metabolic
abnormality that required correction.
3. Cardiovascular: The patient's primary cardiovascular
abnormality was a prolonged QTc which occurred in the setting of
prior use of Haldol and other antipsychotics for behavioral
modification. Her QTc was monitored with serial EKGs. The
longest it had reached was 530 ms. Haldol was discontinued in
order to preserve the QTc. In addition , she was given some
amounts of Seroquel and her QTc was continued to be monitored.
4. Heme/Oncology: The patient has a history of stage III
non-small cell lung cancer status post XRT and chemotherapy and
is followed by her outpatient oncologist , as well as the
outpatient psychosocial oncology social worker , as well as the
psychosocial oncology physician whose name is Chet Nave .
5. Neurological: The patient is status post both a large right
MCA stroke , as well as a right-sided carotid endarterectomy from
a previous admission. Her neurological deficits are consistent
with her prior neurological deficits. Specifically , they include
a left-sided hemiparesis , as well as agnosia on the left side.
Her mental status included intermittent disorientation. She was
generally at her best , alert and oriented to herself , as well as
her age , as well as her location in the Domo Ings Hospital .  However , she would intermittently loose track of where
her location was and believed that she was in Naimas West Hospital , not in
the hospital. She was also intermittently confused. She also is
complicated , given her histories of seizures and stroke. It was
considered initially that her altered mental status was due to
polypharmacy. However , her sedating medications were
discontinued including her Reglan was discontinued as well as her
baclofen , Dilaudid and trazodone. Her Cymbalta was continued per
the recommendations of the Psychiatry consult. The psychiatric
consultants also suggested a one-to-one sitter. At no time was
the patient actively suicidal or homicidal. It was also later
decided that her Dilaudid would be discontinued. In addition ,
her standing Seroquel was made p.r.n. In addition , the
patient's family also suggested that the patient's base mental
status did not improve despite removing all the medications. At
this point , a Neurology consult was obtained. This Neurology
consult is pending at the time of this dictation and will be
reported in a later dictation. Given the patient's history of
complex seizures and olfactory hallucinations , she was continued
on her Lamictal , as well as her Cymbalta , which was for her
history of depression.
6. Pain: The patient's pain in her left hand existed and she
was treated with tramadol and Tylenol for this pain. She could
not specifically describe this pain.
7. Endocrine: The patient was maintained on Novolog sliding
scale for diabetes. She was also continued on a replacement dose
levothyroxine for her history of Graves' and a history of
radioiodine ablation. For behavioral modification , as well as
for intermittent agitation and disorientation , the patient was
maintained on p.r.n. Seroquel 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , as well as
Zydis 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. This was titrated from standing to
p.r.n. over the course of her hospitalization in order to try to
decrease any sedating medications that may be altering her
alertness and orientation.
NOTE: This dictation will be addended at a later date with
discharge medications , as well as further hospital course and the
patient's neurological state , as well as any follow up that is to
be planned.
