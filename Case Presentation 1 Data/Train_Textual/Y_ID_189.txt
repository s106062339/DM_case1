Discharge Date: 3/10/1997
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: MITRAL STENOSIS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Grief is a 74 year old black
female with a history of rheumatic
heart disease and history of atrial fibrillation who was
transferred from an outside hospital for treatment of her
symptomatic mitral valve stenosis. For the past two years , Ms.
Va had experienced a steady very gradual decline in her
exercise tolerance with a decreased ability to make her bed or
vacuum. However , she noticed this only in retrospect. On
6/4/97 , she presented to an outside hospital complaining of the
abrupt onset over one day of weakness , shortness of breath , 1/10
chest pain radiating to bilateral elbows , and dizziness. Symptoms
occurred at rest and were not positional and there were no
relieving or aggravating signs. They lasted approximately nine
hours resolving in the Emergency Department at the outside hospital
before therapy was initiated. Chest x-ray at this time showed mild
congestive heart failure which responded to Lasix 20 mg intravenous
push in the Emergency Department. She was admitted , ruled out for
a myocardial infarction with CK of 31 , 67 , 64 , and 59 , and sent to
catheterization on 3/8/97 which showed a left ostia at 30% , 25 mm
mitral valve gradient , pulmonary artery pressure of 8 , wedge of 18 ,
and cardiac output of 5.3. Echo revealed right and left atrial
enlargement , mild mitral regurgitation , mild tricuspid
regurgitation , ejection fraction was 60% to 65% , and mitral
stenosis with a mitral valve area of 0.9 cm squared down from 1.2
cm squared in 6/10 .  Ms. Sakovitch remained at this outside hospital
for one week essentially symptom free on bedrest and medical
management while awaiting transfer for definitive treatment at the
Ni Rise University Hospitals Of .  She was transferred to the Theay Hospital on the evening of 6/25/97 in good condition
and remained symptom free on bedrest. She complained of no
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , orthopnea , hemoptysis , fever , chills ,
nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , or change in bowel or bladder habits.
Her cardiac risk factors included hypercholesterolemia ,
hypertension , she was not diabetic , did not smoke , and had a plus
or minus family history with a sister who died at 68 of a cardiac
arrest.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for rheumatic heart disease
without a history of rheumatic fever that
was diagnosed in 1994 , she had atrial fibrillation , she ruled out
for myocardial infarction in 6/10 and again prior to admission at
the outside hospital , she had a normal exercise tolerance test in
4/16 , submaximal full without anginal symptoms at baseline , she
had a history of peptic ulcer disease , a hiatal hernia , peripheral
vascular disease , and chronic bronchitis.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for a left saphenous ligation.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: On admission , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Zocor 10
mg p.o. q.d. , isosorbide 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
Coumadin 5 mg q.d. and 2.5 mg Thursday , and Lanoxin 0.125 mg q.d.
ALLERGIES: She was allergic to penicillin which gave her a rash
and to Darvocet which gave her dysphoria.
FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY: Essentially noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was a moderately obese white female
comfortable in bed with a heart rate of 56
and 94 , respiratory rate of 18 , blood pressure of 110-130/70-80 ,
and temperature 98.1. HEENT: Examination was essentially
unremarkable , carotids were 2+ with good upstrokes and no bruits ,
jugular venous pressure was 7 cm , pupils equally round and reactive
to light , extraocular movements intact , cranial nerves intact
bilaterally , supple neck with no lymphadenopathy , and notable for
bilateral arcus senilis. LUNGS: Mild crackles at the right base ,
otherwise clear to auscultation. CARDIAC: Examination was
irregularly irregular , she had an increased S1 , a normal S2 , she
had an opening snap after S2 , she had a soft low diastolic rumble
in the left lateral decubitus at the apex , and she did not have a
sternal heave. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender , nondistended , had bowel
sounds , did not have hepatojugular reflux , and did not have masses.
EXTREMITIES: Warm , well perfused without clubbing or cyanosis , she
was moving all of her extremities quite well , and she had good
distal pulses. Strength was grossly intact and symmetric at 5/5
throughout and she did have some nonblanching slightly raised
pruritic red plaques on her left ankle consistent with psoriasis
which was diagnosis which she carried. NEUROLOGICAL: She was
alert , oriented , conversant , appropriate , and interactive and had a
grossly nonfocal neurologic examination.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , significant for CHEM 7 with
a sodium of 137 , a potassium of 4.0 ,
chloride of 99 , bicarbonate 26 , BUN 21 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose of
86 , white count of 5.5 , hematocrit of 42.3 , and 284 , 000 platelets.
PT was 12.9 , PTT was 82.2 , and magnesium of 2.2. Urinalysis was
essentially clean. ECG showed atrial fibrillation in the sixties
without ST-T wave abnormalities , axis about 30 degrees , normal R
wave progression , and no evidence of chamber enlargement on EKG.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Carrahan , in-house , was taken to valvuloplasty
on 7/27/97 which was without event. She had
valvuloplasty and mitral diastolic gradient was lowered from
approximately 8 mm of mercury to approximately 10 mm of mercury.
Her postprocedure course was uncomplicated , however , slightly
prolonged while transitioning back onto Coumadin
postcatheterization.
DISPOSITION: She is discharged on 9/3/97 in stable condition.
