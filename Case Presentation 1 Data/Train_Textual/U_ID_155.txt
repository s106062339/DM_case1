LABORATORY ON ADMISSION: Notable for a troponin of 0.89 ,
creatinine of 2.3 , Hct 30.5 , WBC 22.15. Chest x-ray revealed a
left lower lobe opacity , question post obstructive pneumonia.
EKG revealed irregular inferior lead T wave inversions and a new
Q in lead 3 , also T wave inversion in the lateral leads , lost R
waves in V2 and V3 compared to earlier EKG of February 2004.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Was notable for a temperature
of 99.9 , heart rate 91 , BP 132/61 , respirations 36 , satting 96%
on 3 liters. The patient was in no acute distress. His JVP was
flat. His heart exam was notable for a 3/6 diamond shaped
systolic murmur at the base. Lungs had diminished breath sounds
bilaterally and crackles over the left lower lobe. He did have
wheezes. Abdomen was soft , nontender and nondistended. Rectal
exam was guaiac negative.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Cardiovascular. Patient has history of critical aortic
stenosis with valve area of 0.9 cm2. He did present with syncope
ultimately of unknown cause , but possibly related to his AS. At
presentation he also had an non-ST elevation MI with peak
troponin of 0.89. This did trend down in the days following
admission. Four days following admission the patient also had an
episode of acute pulmonary edema which was thought to be ischemic
in nature. This did resolve with Lasix and patient was seen by
Cardiology consult who reviewed the case and confirmed that this
patient is not a surgical candidate for aortic valve repair. It
was also felt that the risks of valvuloplasty would outweigh the
potential benefits and that percutaneous intervention via
catheterization likewise was not indicated at this time given the
patients multiple other comorbidities. The patient will follow
up in Cardiology Clinic with Dr. Ralph Flato . She would
like to see him one to two weeks after discharge and her office
will contact patient's family to set up appointment.
2. Infectious Disease. Infiltrates seen on chest x-ray at
admission felt to be pneumonia. The patient was treated with a
10 day course of levofloxacin and Flagyl and was discharged on no
antibiotics.
3. Pulmonary. The patient was treated for COPD exacerbation
during this admission. He was discharged on 30mg of prednisone
with instructions to taper 10mg every 3 days starting the day
following discharge.
4. Endocrine. At the time of admission the patient was on a
regimen of NPH 21 units q.a.m. and 11 units q.p.m. This was
adjusted over the course of his hospitalization and at the time
of discharge he is discharged on 32 units of NPH q.a.m.and 6
units of NPH q.p.m.
5. Renal. Patient had some acute renal failure at admission
likely related to his cardiac status and some intravascular
volume depletion. His creatinine did normalize and he was at
baseline at the time of discharge.
6. Hematology. Patient's hematocrit did fall gradually over the
time of his admission and he was transfused of one unit packed
red blood cells in order to maintain his hematocrit greater than
30.
PLAN: The patient is discharged to rehabilitation in stable
condition on 10/17/05 .
