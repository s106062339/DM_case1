HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 54 year old gentleman
with a past medical history
significant for diabetes mellitus , obesity , coronary artery disease
status post coronary artery bypass grafting and pacemaker placement
in 1996 and 1999 respectively , who presented on 7/16/2000 with a
four day history of cough , fevers , chills , myalgias and left eye
pain. The patient also noted over the course of four days prior to
admission , that his p.o. intake had been decreasing. He had been
experiencing nausea and vomiting without diarrhea and fevers to 103
degrees. On the day of admission the patient noted the sudden
onset of vision loss in his left eye associated with redness and
pain. In the Emergency Room the patient was given Diamox , aspirin
and nitropaste in response to T-wave inversions anteriorly on his
electrocardiogram. In addition , the patient was cultured and
started on broad spectrum antibiotics including Ceftriaxone ,
azithromycin and Gentamycin.
PHYSICAL EXAM: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 99.2 , heart rate 60 ,
blood pressure 118/78 , 98% oxygen saturation on 100
percent face mask. HEENT: OS with hazy , edematous cornea ,
moderately dilated fixed pupil with erythema and injected
conjunctiva. NECK: Supple without lymphadenopathy , no carotid
bruits and no jugular venous distention. LUNGS: Bibasilar scant
crackles. CHEST: Distant heart sounds. Regular rate and rhythm.
No murmurs , rubs or gallops. S3 , loud S2. EXTREMITIES: Minimal
edema , no cyanosis. 2 plus peripheral pulses. ABDOMEN: Obese ,
soft , nontender and nondistended. Normal bowel sounds. Difficult
to assess. NEUROLOGICAL: Nonfocal. RECTAL: Guaiac negative
brown stool.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Chemistry panel showed BUN 74 ,
creatinine 2.8 ( baseline 1.0 ) ,
otherwise normal. Albumen 2.4 , liver function studies otherwise
normal. CK 169 , troponin 1.7 , CBC showed a white blood cell count
of 5.5 , hematocrit 33 , platelets 51. Electrocardiogram showed
paced rate of 60 with T-wave inversions of V1-V6. Chest x-ray
showed cardiomegaly with vascular redistribution. No focal
infiltrates noted. CT of the head showed no evidence of acute
bleed. Urinalysis essentially negative.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Infectious disease: The patient was
initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics
in the Emergency Room and was rapidly noted to be hypotensive with
a systolic blood pressure in the 72. The patient was hydrated
aggressively and consistently pan cultured. The patient began to
spike fevers from 100 to 101 range. On the second hospital day ,
the patient grew 4/4 bottles of what turned out to be Group B streptococcus.
The patient's antibiotics were changed to Penicillin and Gentamycin. A
transesophageal echocardiogram was performed on the day of
admission and did not demonstrate any vegetation , however with
persistent high spiking fevers , sepsis and 4/4 blood culture
bottles , repeated blood cultures growing GBS the patient had repeat
transesophageal echocardiogram. This demonstrated a 1.5x1.0
centimeter vegetation on the anterior annulus of the tricuspid
valve and it was also noted to be hitting the pacemaker wire though
not fixed to it. Of note , the bubble study on the echocardiogram
was negative for patent foramen ovale.
The patient presented complaining of left eye pain and loss of
vision on the night of admission in the Emergency Room , the
ophthalmologist saw the patient and determined that the patient had
an elevated pressure. The elevated pressure was treated and he
responded well by the following day. At that time the patient's
eye was aspirated and noted to also be infected by GBS. The
patient was injected intraocular with Vancomycin at that time.
Unfortunately the patient continued to spike fever despite
appropriate therapy for his GBS and his eye appeared to be
worsening with continued erythema , conjunctival edema and a
purulent exudate. It was determined that the patient would require
enucleation which he underwent on 5/10/2000.
The patient also had a right lower extremity cellulitis during his
hospital course. This was treated with a ten day course of
dicloxacillin and resolved without complications. The patient's
course was complicated by persistent fevers despite appropriate
antibiotic therapy and left eye enucleation. An extensive work up
was undertaken to evaluate the fevers including evaluation for
possible epidural abscess , psoas abscess and infected joints. None
of these proved to be a source. The patient underwent multiple
joint aspirations ( see musculoskeletal section below ) without clear
evidence of infection. The patient also underwent a tagged white
blood cell scan which demonstrated increased uptake in the left
shoulder , manubrium , right knee , left ankle and mid shaft of the
left tibia. These were interpreted both on the initial views and
delayed views as consistent with acute inflammation but not
diagnostic of infection. As mentioned above the patient was also
treated for cellulitis and underwent left eye enucleation. The
patient's fever curve trended down throughout the hospital stay and
on the day prior to admission , the patient underwent a repeat
transesophageal echocardiogram to ensure that there was no
myocardial abscess. There was no evidence of any abscess and the
vegetation was no longer visible. It was felt that the low grade
fevers were secondary to ongoing inflammation but no acute
infectious process at the time of discharge. The patient's last
positive blood culture was 4/3/2000.
Of note , there was concern that the patient's fever could be
secondary to a drug reaction. Therefore once the infectious work
up was completed , the Penicillin was changed to Vancomycin. His
gram positive coverage will need to be continued for four weeks
after his left eye enucleation.
2. Ophthalmology: As described above , the patient presented with
left eye pain and vision loss. It was felt from the time of
presentation that the patient would not recover vision in his left
eye. The patient was treated initially for his elevated pressure
and then the following day his eye was aspirated and injected with
Vancomycin. Ultimately the patient had left eye enucleation. The
patient's eye healed well through the remainder of his hospital
course and does not appear to be a source of infection thereafter.
The patient's extraocular muscles were left intact with the thought
of placing a prosthesis at a later date.
3. Cardiovascular: On admission the patient was noted to have
T-wave inversions anteriorly on his electrocardiogram. However it
rapidly became clear that his pacemaker was malfunctioning
demonstrating only occasional pacing spikes. By 6/24/2000 the
pacemaker was no longer capturing or sensing. As mentioned above ,
the wire did not appear to be incorporated in the vegetation noted
on the tricuspid valve however it did appear that the vegetation
was hitting the pacemaker wire with systole and diastole. On
6/13/2000 the patient underwent pacemaker explantation without
complications.
The indication for pacemaker placement had been for bradycardia.
There was some concern throughout the patient's hospital course
that the patient would become bradycardic without his pacemaker in
place however this never manifested as a problem. He did
demonstrate some runs of ventricular tachycardia during the early
phase of his hospital course but this resolved as his sepsis
resolved. He did have one episode of supraventricular tachycardia
thought to be 1-1 conduction of his atrial arrhythmia. His
Lopressor was increased in response to this and the patient was
tolerating this dose without episodes of bradycardia or
hypotension.
The patient as mentioned above , underwent a transesophageal
echocardiogram at the time of admission which demonstrated an
ejection fraction of 35 percent , apical hypokinesis , moderately
dilated right ventricle with moderately depressed systolic
function. Mild inferior vena cava dilatation consistent with
elevated right heart filling pressures. The patient's cardiac
function appeared to be stable throughout his hospitalization. he
did rule out for myocardial infarction at the time of admission.
4. Musculoskeletal: One of the patient's major presenting
complaints was significant arthralgia and myalgia. It was though
that along with left ophthalmitis , the patient could have septic
polyarthritis. The patient underwent several arthrocentesis by the
rheumatology service. Though the fluid did demonstrate elevated
white blood cell count it was never clear that these were acutely
infected. There were no bacteria on gram stain or culture. The
patient's right knee continued to be tender , erythematous and warm
during the initial part of the hospitalization. Therefore the
patient went to arthroscopic examination on 7/16/2000. The
patient's knee was lavaged with 9 liters of sterile saline prior to
closing all of the effusion was drained. There were no
complications. The patient continued to have symptoms of right knee
effusion and pain and therefore returned to the operating room on
10/28/2000 for repeat arthrocentesis. Since that time the right
knee has reaccumulated a moderate sized effusion but the patient
has tolerated physical therapy and has regained a moderate amount
of his range of motion. It was determined that the patient should
not have this effusion drained again because it was no longer warm
or erythematous.
The left shoulder was also quite tender during the initial hospital
stay. The patient underwent multiple joint aspirations of the
glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints , both at the bed side and
under fluoroscopic examination. Again , this joint demonstrated
elevated white blood cell count but never any clear evidence that
it was a septic joint.
The patient after his left eye enucleation , was noted to have an
elevated CK of 1522. It was thought that this was an insignificant
MB fraction. It was not felt that there was enough manipulation to
skeletal muscles during the enucleation to warrant this. This rise
in CK did coincide with increased muscle aches. It was felt that
the patient perhaps had a mild episode of rhabdomyolysis which
resolved quickly to a CK of 177 five days later.
At the time of discharge the patient is experiencing no myalgias or
arthralgias with the exception of the right knee which is still
somewhat limited in its range of motion and demonstrates an
effusion but is responding well to rehabilitation.
5. Pulmonary: The patient was quite stable from a pulmonary
standpoint throughout his hospitalization. The patient was
initially maintained in the Emergency Room on high flow oxygen
however was quickly weaned to nasal cannula and then room air. The
patient does have obstructive sleep apnea and used his BIPAP at
night throughout his hospitalization.
6. Hematology: On admission the patient demonstrated a
thrombocytopenia with a nadir of 51. This has improved throughout
his hospital course and on the day of discharge his platelets were
noted to be 538.
The patient was noted to have hematocrit that trended down and
corresponded to some guaiac positive stools with anticoagulation.
The patient received a total of four units of packed red blood
cells. His hematocrit has remained stable with a good reticulocyte
count at the time of discharge.
The patient was anticoagulated for his atrial fibrillation
initially with Heparin and then ultimately with Coumadin 10 mg p.o.
q HS. The patient's INR has been therapeutic in the 2-3 range for
approximately five days.
7. Renal: On admission the patient was noted to have an elevated
creatinine from his baseline of 1.0. This was thought to be
secondary to dehydration and prerenal azotemia. The patient's
creatinine reached a peak of 3.0 and stabilized at 1.3 at the time
of discharge. This appears to have resolved entirely with
resolution of sepsis and rehydration.
8. Fluids/electrolytes/nutrition: The patient was significant
dehydrated at the time of admission. This responded rapidly to in
vitro fertilization. He also regained his appetite as his sepsis
resolved. The patient is noted however to have a very poor
albumen , which is 2.3 at the time of discharge. The patient will
require improved nutrition at rehabilitation and after discharge
from rehabilitation. The patient's electrolytes were relatively
stable throughout his hospital stay.
9. Endocrine: The patient has a long standing history of type II
diabetes mellitus. On admission , he was taking metformin 1000 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , regular insulin 10 q a.m. and 10 q p.m. , NPH insulin
25 q a.m. and 20 q p.m. His hemoglobin A1-C was noted to be
elevated at 8.1 in 11/15 The patient's metformin was held
throughout his hospital stay with the anticipation of possible
invasive procedures. He is maintained and NPH insulin as well as
sliding scale insulin. The patient was restarted on his metformin
prior to discharge and increased dose of NPH insulin. This will
likely need to be adjusted as the patient recovers further.
10. Gastrointestinal: The patient did develop guaiac positive
stools during his anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation. This
will need to be followed up as an outpatient once the patient has
made a full recovery from the acute event. Also the patient did
demonstrate a mild transaminitis during his hospital stay and this
appears to have resolved with the transition from Penicillin to
Vancomycin for his antibiotic regimen.
