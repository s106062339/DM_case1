Discharge Date: 5/27/2007
ATTENDING: OBEY , LAWRENCE MD
SERVICE: Obstetrics/Maternal Fetal Medicine.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Pre-gestational diabetes.
2. History of coronary artery disease.
3. Recurrent SABs
4. Hepatitis B.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 36-year-old G16 ,
P0-0-15-0 , who presented at 6 and 4/7 weeks by LMP
consistent with ultrasound of the day of admission , as a transfer
from the High-Risk Obstetric Clinic , admitted to the Fuller
Antepartum Service for diabetic control. The patient had
presented to the Special OB Clinic as a new patient for prenatal
care. Review of her medical problems revealed that the recent
glucose control had been suboptimal. In view of this and in view
of the fact that the patient had multiple other issues , the
patient was admitted for diabetic control , adjustment of her
insulin regimen and evaluation regarding the other medical
problems.
History of present pregnancy: the patient had a last
menstrual period in the second week of October . Ultrasound on the
day of admission , 9/5/07 , revealed a 6.6-week intrauterine
pregnancy with a fetal heart rate of 110. The estimated date of
confinement is 4/19/07. Prenatal screening labs were pending at
the time of admission. The patient has blood group O +ve.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient has a history of ST elevation
myocardial infarction in 2000. The infarct was a presumed
embolism to the left anterior descending and the left circumflex coronary
artery. The complete occlusion of the mid-to-distal left
anterior descending artery , which was thought to be due to
thrombosis , was treated with TPA and angioplasty. The patient had
a normal catheterization in October 2000. The last echocardiogram
revealed an ejection fraction of 45% in 2002; however , the
patient never had a repeat echo since that time. On the day of
admission , the patient reported that she was able to climb four
flights of stairs to her apartment , haveing to pause after two flights of
stairs to catch her breath.
In addition , the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus , diagnosed in 2000.
The patient had a medical admission in 2006 for hypoglycemia when she
incidentally injected Humalog instead of Lantus. On the day of admission , the
patient was on a Humalog 7 units b.i.d. and Lantus 12 units in
the evening. Her fasting sugars were in the 150s before admission and her
blood sugar measurements were over 200 in the evening. On the day of
admission , the fasting sugar was 123.
In addition , the patient has a history of hepatitis B ,
diagnosed in 2005. The patient had a positive E antigen in 2005.
She had previously been on Epivir 150 mg p.o. daily , but this
was stopped prior to the current pregnancy.
PAST OB/GYN HISTORY: The patient has a history of a fibroid
uterus , and a history of recurrent miscarriages. In terms of the
fibroid uterus , the patient did report pelvic pain in the
outpatient setting. Ultrasound had shown an 8-10 cm
dominant posterior fibroid. The patient occasionally takes
oxycodone for fibroid pain.
In terms of the patient's recurrent miscarriages , the patient had fifteen SABs
in the past with over 10 dilatation and evacuations , including one molar
pregnancy with subsequent choriocarcinoma. All losses were in the first
trimester , less than 12 weeks' gestation. The patient had been
evaluated previously for a thrombophilia workup , but this had
been negative multiple times aside from a MTHFR gene mutation ,
which was noted on this admission , and it is unclear whether this
has been addressed previously. The patient had previously been
told by a reproductive endocrinologist , that she should consider
adoption or a gestational carrier. Chromosomes on several
pathology specimens from the previous abortions showed
aneuploidy.
The patient currently denies a history of sexually
transmitted infections. She has a history of cervical dysplasia ,
with a history of CIN I and CIN II in 1990 and 1992. She
underwent a LEEP in 1992 , which was consistent with HSIL. All
subsequent Pap smears were either within normal limits. Last Pap
smear done in February 2006 at Rexmo Sha Hospital Of was insufficient for
analysis. In terms of the patient's history of choriocarcinoma , the patient
had a molar pregnancy , which then developed into a subsequent choriocarcinoma.
For this , the patient was treated with methotrexate , actinomycin D and Cytoxan ,
then VP-16 , cisplatin and bleomycin with presumed cure.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Dilatation and evacuation x10 ,
hysteroscopy for infertility workup , and LEEP.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Humalog Insulin 7 units twice a day ,
Lantus 12 units in the evening , aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily stopped
prior to pregnancy , history of lamivudine/Epivir use , 150 daily
stopped prior to current pregnancy.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Former smoker , given up smoking in 2000 after a
myocardial infarct. No history of alcohol abuse or IV drug use.
The patient lives in Doreska Dr , Nah Min Knox with her boyfriend , unemployed.
FAMILY HISTORY: No history of GYN malignancies , history of
maternal diabetes , longstanding. Father with coronary artery
disease in his 50s.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for the primary
purpose of diabetic control.
1. Diabetes mellitus. The patient had reported poor diabetic
control as an outpatient. Therefore , her regimen was continued ,
with the addition of a sliding scale , in order to determine the
additional insulin needs as an outpatient. Over the course of
the admission , the patient's Lantus was increased to 20 units at
nighttime , and she was using 8 units three times a day of insulin
lispro , in addition to a lispro sliding scale. With this
regimen , the fingerstick glucose control improved , and the
fasting blood sugar on the day of discharge was 90. On the day
prior to discharge , the patient had blood sugars in the range
from 93 to 139. An HbA1c was sent , which was 6.7 , during this
admission , the patient also had a Nutrition consult. She will be
followed in the High-Risk Obstetric and Diabetic Clinic by Dr.
Borguez
2. Cardiology. The patient was restarted on her aspirin , given
her history of myocardial infarct at a very early age. In
addition , an echocardiogram was obtained on the day after
admission. This revealed an ejection fraction of 50% as well as
a large left ventricular thrombosis , which was presumed to be a
longstanding. Cardiology was consulted and the impression was
that the thrombosis was likely a combination of her left
ventricular hypokinesia related to the previous infarct , as well
as her hypercoagulable state. Therefore , their recommendation
was to start the patient on Lovenox for the duration of this
pregnancy , which adjusted for her weight was a dose of 90 mg
daily , followed by a transition to Coumadin postpartum , to be
continued for likely long-term , possibly lifelong duration. The
Cardiology Consult Team noted that the MTHFR mutation had not
resulted in elevated homocysteine levels in the past. However ,
they did agree that folate supplementation at high doses was
indicated. The patient will be continued on Lovenox 90 mg daily
subcutaneously , and aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily as an outpatient.
She will have Cardiology followup with Dr. Jasper Erps on
3/6/07. During the entire admission , she was hemodynamically
stable , in sinus rhythm , with no complaints of chest pain ,
shortness of breath or palpitations.
3. Hepatitis B. The patient had liver function tests and a
hepatitis panel on this admission , given her history of active
disease diagnosed in 2005 , with a positive hepatitis E antigen.
On admission , the patient had not been on Epivir , which had been
stopped prior to this current pregnancy. Liver function tests
were checked on this admission and were within normal limits. In
addition , serologies were checked and the hepatitis E antigen and
the E antibody was negative. Hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B
core antigen were reactive. At the time of this dictation , a
hepatitis B viral load was pending. Given the patient's history
of hepatitis B , an outpatient appointment was being arranged at
the time of discharge , with Dr. Lavy , from the Division of
Gastroenterology at the Sasspan Hospital . It was
decided that the patient should not take any lamivudine until
Gastroenterology followup. During the entire hospital stay , the
patient did not have any GI complaints , was tolerating a regular
diet , and having normal regular bowel movements.
4. history of fibroids , the patient was noted again to have an 8-cm fibroid
on her ultrasound scan. She required rare intermittent doses of
oxycodone as required for pain , which was presumed to be related
to her fibroid uterus.
5. Prenatal care. The patient had her first trimester labs sent
on this admission. GC and chlamydia testing were negative.
Urine culture was negative. The patient was O +ve. Given the
patient's history of MTHFR mutation and the recurrent SABs , the
patient was started on prenatal vitamins , as well as high-dose
folic acid , B12 and B6. In view of the patient's diabetic
history , and a transiently elevated creatinine to 1.2 on hospital
day 2 , which went back to 0.7 on the day of discharge , the
patient had a 24-hour urine collection sent , this returned
negative at 92 mg per 24 hours. It was noted that the patient
had an Ophthalmology retinal exam at an outside hospital health
center this year. For the remainder of this pregnancy , it was
noted that the patient will require ultrasounds at 11 and 17
weeks , as well as a fetal echo , and the recommended testing for
pre-gestational diabetics for the remainder of the pregnancy.
The patient was discharged in a stable condition , with followup
appointments arranged for the various specialties.
