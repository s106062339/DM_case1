Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: YONG KINGSTON MD , PHD
The patient is an TUHAMC patient. Her primary cardiologist is Dr.
Pegram
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Flora is a 50-year-old woman
with coronary artery disease and extensive vascular disease who
presented to the ED with worsening chest pain at rest and at
baseline has exertional chest pain. She had been experiencing
increasing chest pain of late and was referred to CT surgery for
surgical evaluation to correct her CAD and ischemia. She had
been at an office visit on the date of admission with Dr. Rudicil
and began to experience terrible chest pain and Dr. Nacke
referred her to the Clare Taho Medical Center ED for an urgent
evaluation. In the ED , she was noted to be afebrile with a
temperature of 98 , blood pressure 91/54 , respirations 16 , and
satting 98% on 2 liters. She was noted on EKG to be in normal
sinus rhythm with 2-mm ST depressions in II , III , and aVF V4
through V6. She was given aspirin , morphine , metoprolol ,
Mucomyst , Ativan , nitroglycerin and was made pain-free and was
sent to the cath lab for the concern that her stent to the
diagonal #1 placed 6/21/04 was no longer patent , as a cause for
her unstable angina. She had been recently told that no further
intervention was possible after her stent to the diagonal #1.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease
status post CABG in 1996 , which involved LIMA to LAD ( free ) and
SVG to OM1. Peripheral vascular disease. Status post FEM-POP and
fem-fem bypass in 2003. End-stage renal disease status post
cadaveric renal transplant in 1987 , currently immunosuppressed.
IDDM , hyperlipidemia , hypertension , retinopathy , TIA , lower GI
bleed , chronic diarrhea , CMV colitis , anemia , and bladder CA ,
recent diagnosis not yet worked up.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aspirin 81 mg , azathioprine 50 mg a
day , calcium carbonate 650 mg b.i.d. , Colace 150 mg b.i.d. ,
lispro sliding scale , Lantus , multivitamin , folate , Lopressor 25
mg t.i.d. , prednisone 5 mg a day , Zocor 80 mg q.h.s. , Plavix 75
mg q. day as well as Zetia 10 mg a day.
ALLERGIES: Sulfa , Benadryl , penicillin , and Compazine.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives with her husband and has two children.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On admission , Ms. Ameling was taken to the
cardiac catheterization suite where it was found that her
circumflex was 60% , which had been 60% stenosis , now 100%
stenosed. Her diagonal #1 status post stent was now 100%
stenosed and all other native disease and graft disease was
unchanged. Her right heart cath revealed elevated filling
pressures and PTCA and stent was carried out of the occluded
diagonal #1 stent as well as the LAD , but she became hypotensive ,
bradycardic , and developed cardiogenic shock requiring CPR and
intubation. She had an IBP placed and subsequently an echo was
done to rule out effusion and was negative , but had an apparently
low EF. She had suspected transient decrease in flow to her
septal arteries and this likely compounded her acute myocardial
infarction. Following insertion of the intraaortic balloon pump ,
it was noted that she had absent pulses in her right foot , which
was noted also to be cool to touch. She was transferred to the
CCU , intubated and sedated , unresponsive.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her JVP was elevated. Her lungs had
coarse breath sounds anterolaterally , but without crackles or
wheezes. Her heart was regular , tachycardic with a gallop and a
3/6 harsh systolic murmur at the base of her heart and a 2/6
holosystolic murmur radiating to the axilla. She had somewhat
decreased bowel sounds , but her belly was soft and nondistended.
Her bilateral lower extremities were cool with absent pulses in
her feet to palpation and her right foot was mottled and was
notably cooler without edema.
LABORATORY DATA: Her CK was over 100 , MB 7 , troponin 0.92 , INR
0.9 , and platelets 191 , 000. She later developed acute renal
failure and dialysis was initiated on Monday , Wednesday , and
Friday schedule. Her echo showed an EF of 30% with severe MR as
well as inferoseptal and inferior akinesis. The balloon pump was
eventually taken out , the dopamine drip was discontinued. She
was stabilized and extubated. She was stable for several days ,
but on 9/1/04 in the evening experienced an episode of unstable
VT arrest requiring shock x 1. no further defibrillation was
needed. She stabilized after her V-TACH arrest and shocking and
per Electrophysiology Service , she was loaded with amiodarone and
has been continued on 200 mg p.o. q.6h. after being titrated off
her amiodarone drip.
BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular:
a. Ischemia: Ms. Quigg has terrible coronary artery disease
and no further intervention can be offered to her after
discussion with both Dr. Kohler 's Surgical team and the EP
Service. She should not undergo any further catheterizations or
revascularization. She is currently on Aspirin , Plavix ,
Lopressor , and Zocor. She was briefly on Lipitor , but this was
discontinued after a bump in her LFTs. She is not on an ACE or
an ARB secondary to her acute renal failure and at the time of
this dictation her renal function remains poor and there are no
plans to restart an ACE inhibitor or ARB.
b. Pump: Ms. Livernoche has ischemic cardiomyopathy with severe
MR and she is undergoing ultrafiltration and regularly is getting
several liters per hemodialysis session as her blood pressure
tolerates.
c. Rhythm: Ms. Mcelhiney had an episode of ischemic and unstable
ventricular tachycardia requiring shocking. Electrophysiology
evaluated her for the possibility of an AICD placement , but this
has been deferred for now and it is unlikely that she will ever
have an AICD placed , certainly not on this hospitalization. She
has been loaded with amiodarone and is currently on 800 mg a day ,
split into 200 mg q.6h. p.o. and after 10 days she should be
changed to 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. This will take place on February She initially tolerated amiodarone very poorly secondary
to nausea , so her dose was titrated up gradually.
c. Peripheral vascular disease: Ms. Fassett has extensive
peripheral vascular disease and Vascular Surgery is following her
for a likely compartment syndrome in her right calf secondary to
ischemia upon insertion of intraaortic balloon pump. She is
having the circumferences of her cath measured once or twice a
day and these have not been increasing , have in fact been
decreasing. Also , her creatinine kinase levels have been
followed as a surrogate for compartment syndrome and these have
been decreasing and are currently normal. At the time of this
dictation , her CK was 75 down from the 10 , 000 range. She was on
heparin for some time and although her cath continues to be
tender , the pain has improved and the function has gradually
returned. Her pulses remained poor. She had lower extremity
noninvasive Dopplers to evaluate her arterial venous flow and no
clot was noted in the venous circulation. There was no comment
made on the FEM-FEM graft , however , but no note was made of an
arterial clot. She should have the circumferences of her right
calf followed closely at the place that they are marked on the
right lower extremity.
2. Renal: Ms. Barrete has acute on chronic renal failure. She
was admitted with a creatinine of 2.7 and her creatinine has been
up and down depending on the timing of her dialysis; however , she
is relatively anuric , but occasionally produces small volumes of
urine and this should be followed carefully as well. She is
continuing on prednisone and azathioprine for her transplant and
she did have one positive UA , but this is not being treated
because it is difficult to assess secondary to her extremely
concentrated urine , but should be followed if she does produce
urine. This may be permanent , but it is not clear at this point
she may be on hemodialysis indefinitely. She is on fluid
restriction per renal recommendations of 1000 cc per day intake
and her ARB is being held for now.
3. ID: Ms. Helmy spiked on 11/5/04 to 101.8 and she has
been found to have a line infection with a positive triple-lumen
catheter tip as well as positive blood cultures. She was started
on vancomycin on 4/7/04 and this is being dosed according to
her vancomycin troughs , which are drawn once a day. If her
trough is near or below 15 she should be given one dose of
vancomycin and this has turned out to be approximately every
other day.
4. Heme: Ms. Kornn 's platelets have been dropping from the
100s to the mid 50s since she was started on amiodarone. It is
not clear what the source is. She has had two negative HIT
antibodies , platelet factor IV antibodies , and her platelets
seemed to have stabilized in the high 40s , mid 50s and she is not
showing any signs of acute bleed , but this has been communicated
with Electrophysiology Service who is aware of the possibility
that amiodarone may be causing her thrombocytopenia and the
amiodarone has been continued unless her thrombocytopenia worsens
significantly. She is also on a number of other medications that
may cause thrombocytopenia and these will be followed as well ,
however , it was only the amiodarone for which the timing was
coincident with the drop in her platelets.
5. Pulmonary: Ms. Wenrich has a large right pleural effusion;
it was tapped on 10/14/04 , 600 cc were removed. It was noted to
be transudative. The tap was complicated by the patient slipping
off her bed during the procedure. She was caught and did not
fall , but the pleural effusion was not completely drained and she
developed a small hydropneumothorax. This should be followed.
She also had a CT subsequently to rule out hemothorax and there
was no evidence of that. The pleural effusion is evident on her
chest x-rays with underlying consolidation. There has been no
compromise , however , in her apparent pulmonary status and this
should be followed since it will likely reaccumulate after
tapping , but if she becomes more symptomatic it should be tapped.
6. Ms. Delperdang is on prednisone. For her diabetes , she is on
NPH and an insulin sliding scale.
7. She experienced an increase in her LFTs , her transaminases
bumped to several 100s , and her total bilirubin peaked at 1.8 ,
her alkaline phosphatase also bumped , however , this may have been
secondary to the starting Lipitor and this was discontinued.
They have trended down since then. It is not clear exactly the
source of her increase in LFTs. She has been restarted on Zocor
at a very low dose at 10 mg and this should be titrated up as her
LFTs tolerate. She was on Zocor as an outpatient and we hope
that this is not a class effect and that it is not going to be
related to the dose of her Zocor.
8. GI: Her nausea should be treated with p.r.n. Ativan and
Zofran. She has a Compazine allergy.
9. Code status: Ms. Cubeta is DNR/DNI , but family does desire
that if they may help that pressures in shock can be used.
