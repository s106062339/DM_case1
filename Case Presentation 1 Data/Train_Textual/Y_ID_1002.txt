Discharge Date: 10/11/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE NOW STATUS POST PTCA
TIMES TWO AND STENT PLACEMENT.
CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS/PROBLEM LIST: Coronary artery disease status
post three vessel CABG in 1981 ,
hypertension , insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ,
hypertriglyceridemia , status post total hip replacement in 1990 ,
status post cholecystectomy , status post triple hernia repair.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Flicker is a 71-year-old white
gentleman who has a history of
coronary artery disease , status post CABG in 1981 at the Sleyeepathvall Community Hospital who was transferred from Zie-tol Center
with unstable angina for further evaluation and treatment.
The patient's coronary risk factors include insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus , dyslipidemia , hypertension , age , male gender ,
remote tobacco smoking and also known coronary artery disease.
The patient's cardiac history dates back to 1981 when he underwent
three vessel CABG at the Ricks Hospital . The patient
has been in his usual state of health active in the Cape O until he
noticed progressive chest pain with chest tightness and shortness
of breath , but no light-headedness , nausea or vomiting which has
been progressing over the past few months. The patient did not
occur at rest , but occurred with minimal exertion. The patient had
an EKG as an outpatient which showed ST-T wave abnormalities and he
was advised to come to the hospital.
The patient presented to the Box Ro University Hospitals Of and was heparinized.
At that time his CKs were stable and his EKG did not show any
infarction. The patient had an echocardiogram and a Persantine
thallium stress test which was remarkably positive. The patient
developed substernal chest pain after one minute. The patient was
treated with 100 milligrams of aminophylline and two sublingual
nitroglycerines. His EKG revealed 2.5 millimeter ST depression in
leads 2 , AVf and V3-V6. His thallium images showed profusion
abnormalities in the posterolateral , anterior walls and also the
septum. The septum and apex were nearly completely filling in the
rest of the images.
The patient has now been transferred to the Biee Nino Hospital for further evaluation and intervention.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Included the above. He had a CABG in
1981 and by office report , had an SVG to the
LAD in D1 and also and SVG to the distal RCA on OM1.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: On transfer , NPH insulin 12 units subcu q. h.s. ,
aspirin 81 milligrams p.o. q.d. , digoxin 0.25
milligrams p.o. q.d. , Glucotrol 10 milligrams p.o. q. a.m. ,
gemfibrozil 600 milligrams p.o. q. h.s. , Atenolol 100 milligrams
p.o. q.d. , nitropaste 1" q.8h. , IV heparin 1000 units per hour ,
Colace 100 milligrams two b.i.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient works three times a week at the I
and he has a remote history of tobacco with
smoking 1-1-1/2 packs per day for 20 years , but also quit 20 years
ago. The patient drinks infrequently , but used to drink more in
the past.
FAMILY HISTORY: Positive for coronary artery disease in his
sister and his brother. His brother had a CABG
at age 73.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient at this time denies any shortness
of breath , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
orthopnea or dyspnea on exertion.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 98.0 , heart rate 49-53 , blood
pressure 140/70 , respirations 20 , O2
saturation 96% on room air. In general , the patient seemed
comfortable. His sclera were anicteric. JVP was 5 centimeters
with good carotids. Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally
from anterior. Cardiovascular: Regular with a II-III/VI harsh
crescendo , decrescendo systolic murmur in the right upper sternal
border , and also a I-II/VI diastolic decrescendo murmur in the left
lower sternal border. Abdomen was soft , nontender and nondistended
with normoactive bowel sounds. Extremities showed 1+ pitting edema
to the mid shins. Neurologically , he was alert and oriented times
three. Extraocular movement are intact. Pupils are equal , round
and reactive to light , 3-4 millimeters bilaterally. Otherwise , his
examination was grossly nonfocal , but he has mild paresthesias
distally. Reflexes are 0 at the ankles , 0 at the ankles , but
symmetric and 2+ in the upper extremities.
LABORATORY: He has a normal SMA-7. His hematocrit is 41 with
WBCs 7.9 , platelet count 163 , 000. His CK is 104. His
LFTs are within normal limits.
His electrocardiogram shows sinus bradycardia at 51 with first
degree AV block and T wave inversions in 1 and L with ST-T wave
abnormalities in V4-V6.
His chest x-ray shows cardiomegaly with mild superior vascular
redistribution.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. Iamiceli was taken to the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory where a
catheterization revealed a left dominant system with a left main
that was okay and LAD was totally occluded proximally. The left
circumflex had 30% stenosis with 4-50% distal stenosis of the
bifurcation of the left PDA , also with a PDA of 80% lesion with PLV
of 40% and OM1 with a tubular 40% lesion. The RCA was totally
occluded at the ostial region , this was old. SVG to the LAD
looked okay , but the LAD itself distally had 90% lesions. The SVG
to the PDA to OM1 was totally occluded. The SVG to the diagonal
had a 95% ostial lesion. There was no MR. A PTCA was performed
with an SVG to the diagonal also with two 3.5 PS stents placed
resulting in 0% residual.
Also noted by Dr. Keyl , is that the operative notes from Nas Louskoci Prinbap General Hospital from 1981 says that there are two skip SVG
to the PDA to the OM1 , also SVG to the D1 , to the LAD which is
incorrect. There are actually separate SVGs to LAD and to D1 and a
third SVG must be totally occluded to the PDA to OM1.
After the catheterization , the patient was admitted to the
Cardiology Cleve Ti Er , Georgia 46841 Team where he continued to be heparinized and
supported with rate control awaiting a second cardiac
catheterization which was to correct the distal LAD lesions. The
patient had an unremarkable hospital course and underwent his
second cardiac catheterization and PTCA on 10/15/97 which resulted
in the two distal LAD lesions which were each 90%. The patient
underwent PTCA to a residual of 10-20%.
The patient tolerated this procedure well and subsequently had a
very small left groin hematoma , but was otherwise okay. He
remained afebrile with stable vital signs and was discharged on
9/20/97 in good stable condition.
DISPOSITION/FOLLOW UP: The patient was discharged in good and
stable condition on 4/3/97. He will
follow up with Dr. Errol Turgeon in 1-2 weeks. The patient also
will return to have his blood drawn for a CBC check in two weeks
and also in four weeks because he is discharged on Ticlid.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 milligrams p.o.
q.d. , Atenolol 100 milligrams p.o. q.d. ,
