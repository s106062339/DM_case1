BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: leg swelling
-----
HPI: 71 yo male with h/o DM , HTN , and poss CHF
( pt denies and unclear from documenation ) here with 2 weeks of LE
edema. Of note pt was difficult to obtain a history from and there
is little consistency between his story on admission and what
was recorded by his PCP in his S chart. Pt states he has had
increasing LE swelling for 2 weeks despite taking all of his
medications. Pt states that he has not increased his Na intake
recently. Pt repeatedly denied SOB , increased abd girth , and PND.
Pt did note that he sleeps on 2 pillows at night but his breathing
his fine when he is lying flat.
Next day spoke with patient's wife who confirmed story documented by PCP
including increasing shorntness of breath and orthopnea.
ED: lasix 120 IV x 1 ROS: no fevers , chills , or night sweats. No
ST , hearing problems , or visual problems. No SOB , but
does note non-productive cough x 1 day. No CP , palpitations ,
orthopnea , or PND. No abd pain , N/V , diarrhea , BRBPR. Pt does
endorse nocturia stating that he gets up 6-7 times/night to urinate.
No dysuria or hematuria. No joint pains or rashes.

CONSULTS: Pulmonary Medicine ( Dr. Kohlmeyer )
-----
IMP: 71 yo male with h/o DM , HTN , and poss h/o CHF who presents with
2 weeks of LE edema.
-----
PLAN:
CARDS:
I: No known h/o CAD-little concern for ACS with no sxs except LE
edema -unclear why not on ASA , no h/o GI bleed or ulcer. Will start ASA
for primary/secondary prevention. Checked lipid profile , trigs very
elevated at 482 and HDL 24. LDL could not be peformed b/c trigs were so
high. Started gemfibrozil , pt can have repeat lipid profile as outpt and
statin at discretion of PCP. Pt was continued on BB but dose was
decreased to 50mg po daily as pt having asymptomatic bradycardia to 40's
while sleeping.
P: Pt's OS notes list CHF as dx , pt denies any h/o LE edema or CHF
before 2 weeks ago but is on lasix bid at home. Last echo in 4/3
showed LVH w/ preserved EF. Pt with likely diastolic dysfunction. Pt on
exam has only LE edema , but received 120 IV lasix in ED. Pt's
presentation c/w CHF exacerbation but BNP of 13 is unusual. Continued
to diurese pt with IV lasix and once he was approaching euvolemia
switched him back over to home dose. Pt's LE edema likely multifactorial
due to CHF and some component of chronic venous stasis. LENIs were
checked and were negative for DVTS. Discontinued pt's CCB as may be
contributing to LE edema. Echo was repeated this admit which
showed EF 60-65% and signs of diastolic dysfunction.
HTN: BP was controlled this admit. Pt was continued on BB , norvasc , &
catapres
R: no issues this admit
ENDO: Pt has h/o DM and pt states he is taking insulin at home ( unclear
dose ). Pt was started on Lantus with SS novolog and his sugars were
somewhat elevated. Advised pt to restart home insulin regimen after d/c.
Sent HgA1C but was still pending at the time of discharge.
RENAL: pt appears to have CKD per SHC recs -baseline 1.4-1.6 , renally
dose meds
NEURO: Pt's wife noted that pt has intermittently been confused at home.
She describes episodes when he wakes up at night and doesn't know where
he is. This is likely due to hypoxia as pt has severe sleep apnea and
rarely wears cpap at home. Pt was alert and oriented during this admit.
Sent labs to evaluate for secondary cause of dementia and they were
negative. Suggested that pt f/u with PCP if these episodes persist.
PULM: Pt with h/o sleep apnea. Per 2003 sleep study pt's sleep apnea
was central and not obstructive although this is difficult to believe
based on pt's body habitus and redundant neck tissue. Pt evaluated by
pulmonary after RA ABG showed PaO2 50's. Pt pulse ox was monitored and
when he fell asleep without his cpap he desatted to low 60's and high
50's. Pt satted in mid 90's on RA while awake and upright. Pulmonary
thought pt likely with obesity hypoventilation syndrome and sleep apnea
( central +/- obstructive ). Pt tried on empiric bipap ( 4/9 ) the night
prior to d/c and felt that he slept much better. Of note pt used the
nasal mask in house but has the full mask at home. Tried to set up pt
for home bipap but is not eligible unless has another sleep study.
Communicated this with pt's PCP who will set up repeat sleep study in
near future. Pt also started on empiric qhs acetazolamide per pulmonary
recs based on recent data showing that it improves symptoms in pt's with
central sleep apnea and heart failure.
