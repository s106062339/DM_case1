Discharge Date: 2/29/1993
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 49-year-old male
with a history of hypertension
admitted with acute anterior myocardial infarction and a very poor
historian. His cardiac risk factors include a history of cigarette
smoking , hypertension , family history , questionable history of
hypercholesterolemia and no history of diabetes. The patient is
followed by Dr. Zirker for hypertension. Approximately one year
ago , he was sitting on a bike awaiting an exercise test and he felt
lightheaded without any chest pain. He was admitted to ACH for
question of rule out myocardial infarction. He had an exercise
tolerance test one day later without chest pain or shortness of
breath. He exercises daily as well as jogging. Two weeks prior to
admission , the patient walked one block , he had acute shortness of
breath while awaiting for a train. He had a head cold with
congestion and cough at that time. He had no chest pain but did
have diaphoresis and mild nausea and vomiting as well as
lightheadedness and some palpitations lasting approximately one
hour in duration. On the day of admission after taking a shower in
the morning , he had increasing shortness of breath gradually at
rest with epigastric tightness without radiation but he did have
nausea , vomiting and diaphoresis. He was seen at Higheun Medical Center because he was "unable to breathe". In the
emergency room he had a blood pressure of 207/150 with saturation
of 93% , rales and positive S4. He was treated with nitroglycerin ,
morphine , Lasix and Nitropaste. He was also given Lopressor , 15
mg. EKG showed Q's in V1-2 , 1-2 mm ST increasing in V1 , lateral T
wave inversions. Blood pressure dropped to 99/67 with treatment
and he was sent for emergent cardiac catheterization.
HOSPITAL COURSE: EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 91 , -15
degrees axis. There were left atrial
abnormalities. There was ST elevation of 1-2 mm in V1-3 , T wave
inversion in I , L , V4-6; Q's in V1 and V2. This was new compared
with prior EKG. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization
which revealed pulmonary capillary wedge of 30 , RV 46/14 , PA 46/30 ,
ramus occluded 50%. The patient developed left arm pain with
inflation and slow flow after PTCA. The patient had decreased
blood pressure and heart rate and was treated with Narcan and
atropine. The patient was treated with nitroglycerin , heparin and
aspirin. He was also started on Lopressor. He was given IV Lasix
for diuresis and magnesium. The patient's third set CPK came back
at 429 with 10 MB's. The patient was stable overnight. His
electrophoresis came back negative. It was felt that an acute
myocardial infarction was less likely and it was felt that
pulmonary edema was secondary to his hypertensive disease being out
of control. His heparin was discontinued and he was switched to
atenolol and lisinopril. The patient underwent exercise tolerance
test where he completed a submaximal predischarge protocol without
pain or dyspnea. His resting EKG showed evidence of anterior
septal myocardial infarction with a peak heart rate of 120 , blood
pressure 180/90. There were some mild fixed defects anteriorly.
He also developed some dysuria after removal of the Foley with
100 , 000 enteric gram negative rods.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home in stable
condition. MEDICATIONS: On discharge included
aspirin , one po q day; lisinopril , 20 mg po q day; atenolol , 100 mg
po q day; Bactrim DS , one po b.i.d. times seven days;
nitroglycerin , p.r.n.; Pyridium , 200 mg po t.i.d. times two days.
The patient will follow-up with Dr. Suydam .
