Discharge Date: 7/6/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
OPERATIVE PROCEDURES: Coronary artery bypass graft x3 , 3/4/97 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Hannen is a 72-year-old female
with no coronary artery disease who
was transferred from an outside hospital with unstable angina , to
the Cardiology Service. Her risk factors include positive family
history , hypertension , and hypercholesterolemia. Her cardiac
history included a myocardial infarction in 1983 , followed by
post-infarct sustained in 1989 , which was treated medically. She
had a preop evaluation prior to bladder surgery , at which time , an
ETT was positive and cardiac cath revealed 70% proximal LAD , 70%
mid LAD , 70% distal LAD , 50% proximal circumflex , total occlusion
of obtuse marginal I , an 80% occlusion obtuse marginal II
occlusion. She was managed medically without any further symptoms
until 11/27 when she developed chest pain on exertion , which was
again treated medically. On 2/9/97 , she was admitted to Ton Valley Hospital And Medical Center for elective bladder suspension which was attempted
laparoscopically but complicated by bladder rupture and was
converted to an open procedure. Intraoperatively , she was noted to
have ST changes. She was taken to the ICU where she ruled out for
a myocardial infarction. However , subsequently , she developed
chest pain and shortness of breath , with ST depression. She was
therefore transferred to the Nin Vensca Memorial for cardiac
catheterization and possible coronary revascularization.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , coronary
artery disease.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Bladder suspension in 1995 and 1997.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: Procardia XL 30 mg p.o. q.d.; atenolol 30 mg p.o.
q.d.; Mevacor 20 mg p.o. q.d.; Premarin 0.625 mg p.o.
q.d.; Bactrim DS 1 tab p.o. b.i.d.; Dilatrate 40 mg t.i.d.;
Compazine 10 mg p.r.n. q.8h.; Darvocet 100 mg p.r.n. q.4h.; heparin
subcu.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient does not smoke.
FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS - Afebrile , pulse 77 , regular , BP
120/60 , two liters saturating 97%. SKIN - No jaundice , no anemia.
No clubbing , cyanosis , or pedal edema. NECK - Soft right carotid
bruit. LUNGS - Clear to auscultation. HEART - Normal heart
sounds , II/VI systolic murmur at left sternal border. ABDOMEN -
Soft , non-tender , non-distended. Surgical incision healing well.
EXTREMITIES - No varicose veins , bilateral dorsalis pedis , 2+
edema.
LABORATORY DATA: Na 133 , K 3.1 , Cl 100 , CO2 30 , BUN 4 , creatinine
0.6 , glucose 106. White count 10.9 , hematocrit
27.4 , platelets 211. EKG normal sinus rhythm , with Q-waves in aVF.
Chest x-ray shows no active infiltrate.
HOSPITAL COURSE: She was taken to the Cath Lab and underwent a
cardiac catheterization on 1/10/97 .  This
revealed an occluded right coronary artery , 70% left circumflex
stenosis , a totally occlused obtuse marginal , 70-80% LAD stenosis ,
serial 70% stenosis in diagonal I , left ventricular ejection
fraction of 50% , and inferior akinesis.
She was taken to the Operating Room on 3/19/97 and underwent
coronary artery bypass graft x3 , LIMA to LAD , saphenous vein graft
to posterior descending artery , saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal.
Postoperatively , he remained in the ICU for three days postop
because of rapid atrial fibrillation which required increasing
amounts of beta blocker therapy. She was transferred out of the
unit on postop day #4. She underwent a cystogram on 4/17/97 which
did not show any evidence of a leak. She continued to remain in
atrial fibrillation intermittently , which responded to increasing
dose of Lopressor and lateral conversion of Lopressor to atenolol
100 mg b.i.d. She continued to develop atrial fibrillation every
morning in spite of increasing doses of atenolol. Therefore ,
procainamide was started on 5/28/97 and she is being discharged on
1/4/97 after having remained in sinus rhythm for 24 hours on
atenolol 100 mg b.i.d. and Procan SR 500 mg q.i.d.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Percocet 1-2
tabs p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain; Coumadin dose
to be based on INR range of 2-2.5; Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.;
cephradine 500 mg q.i.d. x7 days for redness at saphenous vein
graft harvest site above the medial malleolus; Procan SR 750 mg
p.o. q.i.d.
DISCHARGE DIET: No diet restrictions.
DISCHARGE ACTIVITY: As tolerated.
DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP: Arrangements have been made for follow-up
with Dr. Friedeck and Cardiology in one week ,
and Dr. Barcus in 4-6 weeks.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: To home , with services.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable condition.
