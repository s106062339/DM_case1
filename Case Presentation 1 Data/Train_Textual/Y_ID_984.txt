In summary , this patient is a 73-year-old lady with a history of
low back pain , sciatica , morbid obesity , spinal stenosis ,
hypothyroidism , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , posthepatic
neuralgia , rheumatoid arthritis , renal insufficiency , deep vein
thrombosis , bilateral total knee replacement secondary to
degenerative joint disease , who is admitted on 8/15/04 for
worsening low back pain. The following is a continuation of the
hospital events during her stay.
1. Low back pain: As stated before , she suffers from
debilitating low back pain from morbid obesity , spinal stenosis ,
rheumatoid arthritis , and degenerative joint disease. During her
hospitalization , her pain was treated with narcotics as well as a
steroid/analgesic epidural injection. The Pain Service followed
during her discharge day. Her pain control with narcotics was
titrated with a fentanyl patch along with breakthrough p.o.
Dilaudid. She was also titrated up on her chronic pain
medications including Neurontin and Elavil. The patient had a
history of sedation with too much narcotics , and her narcotics
should be titrated for mental status changes. During her stay ,
she received IV conscious sedation MRI , which showed a normal
spinal cord and spinal stenosis , facet involvement. Orthopedics
surgery was consulted early during the hospitalization and they
determined that there was no surgical indication for orthopedic
surgery. They were also reconsulted later on when the patient
appeared to want to have surgery , and at that time orthopedics
surgery determined that the risk-benefit ratio was not in favor ,
and that she was not a surgical candidate in the context of a
newly developed right lower extremity DVT. As mentioned before ,
the patient had an epidural injection with bupivacaine and
steroids on 7/8/05 with minimal initial response to her pain.
However , later , there was some improvement in her pain. The
patient is to follow at the Pain Clinic in two weeks , as further
appointments in the follow up section for a possible repeat
epidural injection. In addition , she is to follow up with Dr.
Farella within four weeks of the Orthopedics Surgery Service for
reevaluation for the orthopedics surgery. In addition , she
received aggressive physical therapy , which slowly enabled her to
improve her range of movement in her lower extremities. She does
have chronic and stable left lower extremity immobility.
However , she is able to move her right leg somewhat and this has
improved slowly over time with aggressive PT. The patient has
very agreeable of recent days to physical therapy and is expected
to continue to improve with continued aggressive physical
therapy. This should be the mainstay of her treatment in
addition to her pain control with her medications. She should be
premedicated with Dilaudid or any pain control medications prior
to any physical therapy session.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient had stable cardiovascular
parameters during her admission and did not require any
significant changes in her outpatient medications. Medications
are as listed in the discharge medications.
3. Endocrine: She has severe diabetes mellitus and insulin
resistence. Her NPH was titrated due to episodes of asymptomatic
hypoglycemia to the range of 45 to 55 in the fasting morning
glucoses of normal need. On discharge , the patient was
maintained on NPH insulin b.i.d. as well as sliding scale of
regular insulin. He also had a history of hypothyroidism and her
Synthroid was continued. She had a history of renal
insufficiency and received a chronic low dose of prednisone. She
did not have any issues while she was in the hospital.
4. Rheumatology: The patient has rheumatoid arthritis. Her
prednisone was decreased in duration of her stay from prednisone
20 mg p.o. q.a.m. to 10 mg p.o. q.a.m. She also is on as an
outpatient on her home dose of methotrexate 20 mg p.o. q. week ,
which was held during her hospitalization due to her acute
issues. However , the methotrexate , which was prescribed by her
outpatient rheumatology , should be restarted as an outpatient as
soon as possible. She takes 20 mg p.o. q. week.
5. Renal: Initially , the patient had a mild increase in her
creatinine on presentation , but this improved to the normal range
with gentle hydration.
6. Infectious disease: The patient had a fever on 4/22/04 to
101 and on 6/26/05 to 101 degrees Fahrenheit. Cultures were
negative. There were white blood cells in her urine and she was
empirically given levofloxacin. She did have cough and sputum ,
and she was found to have MRSA in her sputum and was known to be
colonized at this point , and was placed on precautions. However ,
her chest x-ray was clear. She did not have a clinical
pneumonia. Her lower extremity appeared red and woody and there
was question of cellulitis , and she received 10 days of p.o.
Keflex , although it was unlikely she had two cellulitis.
7. Pulmonary: She likely has obstructive sleep apnea with a
mild decrease in O2 saturations at night. However , this was
never clinically significant. Her body habitus and symptoms were
consistent with obstructive sleep apnea. Chest x-rays were also
taken during her course and were unchanged from her prior.
Although , she has had a history of being fitted for a C-PAP mask ,
she refused to use this.
8. Hematology: She was diagnosed with a DVT in her right leg by
ultrasound on 6/26/05 , and was started on a heparin drip , which
was bridged to warfarin with therapeutic INR during the rest of
her stay. The plan is for her to continue six months of
anticoagulation , then reevaluation by her outpatient primary care
physician. Her current dose of Coumadin is 6 mg p.o. q.h.s. and
this should be checked one week after discharge from the hospital
in order to ensure a goal INR of 2 to 3. Until than she will be
maintained on Lovenox 40 mg subu q.d. in the hospital , and this
can be continued as needed as an outpatient.
9. Physical therapy: As per above , the patient is engaged in
physical therapy and showed improvement over time.
10. GI: The patient has intermittent constipation to her pain
medications and has poor p.o. intake in general , however , this
improved over the course of admission. She requires an
aggressive bowel regimen to keep her regular bowel movements and
she will be often resonant to have a bowel movement due to the
feeling of vertigo during the bowel movements. This , however ,
improved during time. She should be encouraged to allow herself
to have bowel movement in the rest room if she is able. The goal
will be for her to be able to sit on a toilet potty at the
bedside.
11. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient had
intermittent , non-clinically significant hyperkalemia , which
initially was corrected with Kayexalate and bowel movements.
12. Psychiatric: The patient had intermittent vocalization of
not caring if she lived or died because she had lived her life
and she was in pain. She was seen by the psychiatry multiple
times. She did not think that she was suicidal and only need
emotional support to which she responded well. At the time of
discharge , she was euthymic and hopeful and was eager to continue
to improve her quality of life with aggressive physical therapy
and pain control. She was looking forward to continuing her pain
control management follow up visit with pain service.
13. The patient has declared herself to be DNR/DNI.
TO-DO PLAN , FOLLOW-UP PLAN:
1. Aggressive physical therapy and pain control , as directed by
the pain clinic and her primary care physician.
2. After her discharge from rehabilitation , she should follow up
with her rheumatologist Dr. Boughamer , pain clinic , Dr. Cills ,
which is her primary care physician in Orthopedics.
3. She is also noted to be MRSA colonized and should be on
appropriate precautions. She should continue her Coumadin for
six months for her deep vein thrombosis until otherwise directed
by the physician. The pain clinic will consider additional
therapy for pain including epidural repeat as an outpatient. The
patient should restart her methotrexate as an outpatient.
